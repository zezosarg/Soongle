4332,Don Henley,Taking You Home,"I had a good life  
Before you came  
I had my friends and my freedom  
I had my name  
Still there was sorrow and emptiness  
'Til you made me glad  
Oh, in this love, I found strength I never knew I had  
  
[Chorus]  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Take my hand, love  
I'm taking you home  
I'm taking you home  
  
There were days, lonely days  
When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb  
But I kept on believing  
That this day would come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where we can be with the ones who really care  
Home, where we can grow together  
Keep you in my heart forever  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no, no baby  
Take my hand, love  
I'm taking you home  
Taking you home  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no, baby  
Take my hand,  
I'm taking you home  
Yes I am  
I'm taking you home  
Taking you home, baby  
Taking you home

26274,Bonnie Raitt,Hell To Pay,"Hey Mister, we want you to know  
We think, you've taken this about as far as it can go  
It's about to blow  
You got nowhere to run  
Why don't you sit back and watch the show?  
You used to drop your little darlin' off at Sunday school  
Family values while you're gettin' some behind the pool  
She's nobody's fool  
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter  
Wants it bad as you  
You jack up the rent, you call in a loan  
Clear your intent is to screw 'em out of all they own  
Throw the dog a bone  
Well, you'll be cryin' for mercy when  
Your karma calls you on the phone  
Well you know, times are hard  
Ain't it a bitch but  
The Japanese are makin' you twitch  
All your investments are turnin' sour  
It kinda spoils your happy hour  
Look around, we're comin' your way  
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought  
You'd get away, what you say  
Well, the way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait  
The way it looks from here  
No need to hesitate  
Have a party celebrate  
The way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait for hell to pay

26033,Bob Seger,Neon Sky,"Words and music by bob seger  
There's the neon sky that I know so well  
There's the smoky room where I chose to dwell  
Though I hear your heart many miles away  
The neon sky tells me I must stay  
  
Through the windy field of another land  
I have seen your face, girl, I have held your hand  
Though I should be there, with you there today  
The neon sky knows that I must stay  
  
Cause the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been  
  
On a dusty stage, many years ago,  
I chose my road, still I hope you know  
That there'll come a day with the neon sky  
When we'll walk into the sun, you and I  
  
Yes so he calls, beckons unto me  
From the empty hall, from the galleries  
And so I must go, leave you here today  
Cause the neon sky orders me away  
Yes, the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been

41995,Lloyd Cole,Blame Mary Jane,"Blaming Mary Jane I'm drinking cheap  
She's getting prettier by the ....  
She says I should care more for  
The rich and the poor but I  
Can't find the energy blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
Speak plain Mary Jane  
Could you give your hand to a man that  
Never gave a damn  
That's why I rather sleep than thinking  
Nothing more than drinking  
All I want is to blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the long lonesome  
Afternoons, yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the lonesome afternoon  
Oh maybe I won't be your whipping boy  
I won't be your whipping boy  
Shame baby shame oh shame sweet Mary Jane  
I truly do love you  
She said that I should care more  
For that body of yours  
If you carry the weight of the world oh my  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the long lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Maybe I will be your whipping boy  
Maybe I will

23612,Alison Krauss,My Love Follows You Where You Go,"More wishes than a thousand hearts can count for you  
More smiles than a merry-go-round  
The sweetest ending to a bedtime story told  
My love follows you where you go  
  
More laughter than a kindergarten out to play  
One Sunday morning song that says it all  
More summer than the California beach can hold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow  
  
Take forgiveness, take a prayer, take the deepest breath  
And take the answers in your heart  
When you wake up and the world is cruel and cold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow  
  
More freedom than a field of flowers in the day  
More beauty than a mornin' after rain  
Up the steepest hill, a dark and crooked road  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow

42457,Lynyrd Skynyrd,Outta Hell In My Dodge,"Five AM in the mornin', whiskey still runnin' through my head  
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another cigarette  
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work  
The boss is a jerk and I ain't payin' the rent  
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Take the road less traveled  
Spend my life behind the wheel  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Freedom made out of steel  
  
There's a knock on the door from the sheriff  
Askin' me where I was last night  
Seems somebody lookin' a lot like me  
Had takin' up with his wife  
He said son if I ever catch him  
There's gonna be some hell to pay  
He'll be gone for good if I see him again  
'cause I just might blow him away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's a poor man supposed to do  
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues  
Baby, I'm sick of these blues  
  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Well I don't care if I'm wrong or right  
Gotta split this town tonight  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Live my life behind the wheel  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
My freedom made out of steel

40314,King Diamond,Black Horsemen,"So there they stood at the top of the stairs  
Miriam in the mood, Jonathan was scared  
Gazing into the dark, Jonathan saw the star  
For a second he turned his back  
And she was there like a ghost  
She him hard and clean  
To the bottom of the stairs  
  
""Now we're finally alone, Miriam  
Abigail is here to stay""  
  
The birth of Abigail would soon be realized  
The second coming of a devil in disguise  
And the moon did not shine  
It was darker than ever before  
  
On this sacred night  
The soul of Miriam was crying out in pain  
Remembering the day, arrival in the rain  
  
The pain of labor was so strong that Miriam died  
The final seeing was a pair of yellow eyes  
You can still hear her screaming  
If You're walking the stairs in July  
  
Riding from beyond  
The 7 Horsemen would arrive before the dawn  
Servants of the count, when Abigail was born the first time  
  
Oh no, they found her in the sarcophagus  
Baby Abigail was eating, Oh I cannot tell You  
  
""Take her, and bring her  
To the chapel in the forest  
So go now...The ceremony  
And the coffin's waiting""  
  
The Black Horsemen  
  
That's the end of another lullaby  
Time has come for me to say goodnight

The Candle Must Be Burn Again, And Pain  
Must Follow the Unholy Flame  
So Burn...Burn...Burn  
And Free the Spirit From Its Chain""  
  
Here I AM Blinded Again By That Flame  
In Every Candle That I Burn, Burn !  
I See That Same Face Return, It Returns  
  
Eyes In Pain, My Little Queen Are You A Dream  
In Every Candle That I Burn, Burn !  
I See That Same Face Return, It Returns

Tears Are Running From Her Eyes

In Twisted Key She Speaks A Word To Me And Then I See  
Her Face Falling Apart  
The Word ""Jonah"" Is Her Mark, She's Branded

15739,Perry Como,"Chi-baba, Chi-baba","Many a year ago in old sorrento

44652,Morrissey,Will Never Marry,"I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you, but no  
I will live my life as I  
Will undoubtedly die alone  
  
I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you  
I will live my life as I, oh  
For whether you stay  
Or stray  
An in-built guilt catches up with you  
  
And as it comes around to your place  
At five a.m., wakes you up  
And it laughs in your face  
  
Don't speak!  
Sing

22356,Zac Brown Band,Knee Deep,"Gonna put the world away for a minute  
Pretend I don't live in it  
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  
Had sweet love but I lost it  
She got too close so I fought it  
Now I'm lost in the world tryin' to find me a better way  
  
Wishin' I was  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair  
The only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Wrote a note, said ""Be back in a minute""  
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it  
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway  
Mind on a permanent vacation  
The ocean is my only medication  
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away  
  
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
This champagne shore watchin' over me  
It's a sweet sweet life livin' by the salty sea  
One day you can be as lost as me  
Change your geography and maybe you might be  
  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Come on in  
The waters nice  
Find yourself a little slice  
Grab a backpack  
Otherwise you'll never know until you try  
When you lose yourself  
You find a key to paradise

56583,Willie Nelson,Healing Hands Of Time,"They're working while I'm missing you those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine  
They'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind  
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time  
They let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll let me sleep again those healing hands of time  
So already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time

9607,John Prine,Mexican Home,"It got so hot, last night, I swear  
You couldn't hardly breathe  
Heat lightning burnt the sky like alcohol  
I sat on the porch without my shoes  
And I watched the cars roll by  
As the headlights raced  
To the corner of the kitchen wall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mama dear  
Your boy is here  
Far across the sea  
Waiting for  
That sacred core  
That burns inside of me  
And I feel a storm  
All wet and warm  
Not ten miles away  
Approaching  
My Mexican home  
  
My God! I cried, it's so hot inside  
You could die in the living room  
Take the fan from the window  
Prop the door back with a broom  
The cuckoo clock has died of shock  
And the windows feel no pane  
The air's as still  
As the throttle on a funeral train  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My father died on the porch outside  
On an August afternoon  
I sipped bourbon and cried  
With a friend by the light of the moon  
So its hurry! hurry! Step right up  
It's a matter of life or death  
The sun is going down  
And the moon is just holding its breath

She wanted everything  
She wanted boys

Studied their faces  
They didn't want to play with her  
It never ends  
You'll have to starve yourself half to death  
You're never with them  
Your just a fat girl  
A fat girl  
  
A fat girl  
A fat girl

She never moved  
As fast as all the rest

A fat girl

26092,Bon Jovi,Beautiful World,"Every day it's the same when they say that it might be the end  
In the end when it ends then I'll listen to them  
You wake up, go to work, go to sleep, then you do it, you do it  
If you're lucky then you do it again  
  
Yeah we walk through a world that we don't understand

Yeah we'll laugh and we'll cry and we'll lose and we'll win  
We'll get through it and to prove it, yeah we'll do it again  
There's glory in the saddest story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
  
It's a shame when they say that's it's been done and said  
they keep digging that grave,let them bury their heads  
there's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars  
there's another first kiss, in the back of some car  
Turn the page and write the story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.  
  
They're running numbers out of the Spanish coast  
Winery merry Mary says her rosary  
we get a ladder, cause there's a cat up in a tree  
Ah, the pretzel mans wearing Gucci glasses  
A widow spreads her lover's ashes  
I hold on to you, hold on to me, yeah  
  
We'll do it, we'll do it, if we're lucky then we'll do it again  
  
Ah, look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
