48389,Phish,Sample In A Jar,"It's hidden far away  
But someday I may tell  
The tale of metal tangle  
When into your world I fell  
Without you now I wander soaking  
Secretly afraid  
'Cause in your grasp the fears don't last  
(And some of them have stayed)  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didn't hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemor's bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me, a Sample in a Jar  
  
And on the market stands unfolding  
With all their willies and their wares  
I shuffle by alert but numb  
To all the glances and the glares  
And I think of you unheeding  
All the times I raise my cup  
It's now I know that you knew that  
I'd soon end up end up  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didn't hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemor's bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me, a Sample in a Jar  
  
You tricked me like the others  
And now I don't belong  
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

49854,Rage Against The Machine,Bombtrack,"Ughh!  
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack ughh!  
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack yeah!  
It goes a-one, two, three  
  
Hey yo, it's just another bomb track  
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade this  
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level  
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down  
Hand out some beat-downs  
Cold runna train on punk ho's that  
Think they run the game  
  
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete  
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete  
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag  
As I recall our downfall  
And the business that burned us all  
See through the news and the views that twist reality  
  
Enough  
I call the bluff  
Fuck manifest destiny  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
With the thoughts from a militant mind  
Hardline, hardline after hardline  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
  
It goes a one, two, three  
Another funky radical bombtrack  
Started as a sketch in my notebook  
And now dope hooks make punks take another look  
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear  
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere  
  
With the thoughts from a militant mind  
Hardline, hardline after hardline  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn!

27724,Christina Aguilera,Remember,"I remember that time when I first laid eyes on you  
I looked into your eyes and I knew all my dreams would come true  
With you  
Then you left last summer and rest of your family  
And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity  
  
Chores  
It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to  
Be as stong as you'd like to be  
Because you left me here with only one memory  
  
How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done  
How could stand blaming for what I have done  
What I have done  
  
It was a cold night and I was at home crying over you my  
Friends were there to calm me and I got up and I jumped  
Over the balcony  
  
I......  
I blame you my.... My friends do to  
It was all.... All because of you  
Because you left me to find someone new

46011,Nirvana,Anorexorcist,"You need a path to cross  
Into a place where everyone you see  
Has had a time to try to Play!  
  
If you go get shot  
When you'll be what you name  
Protector of your gun  
Everyone plays with your gun  
  
Way, way, way, way  
Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain  
Want to see you try to play  
I want to describe you  
Put your name as a national woman  
I don't like your coffee  
I want to have your friendship  
As a jock, and to the top  
  
Way, way, way, way

1607,Bob Dylan,Disease Of Conceit,"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

11021,Kyla,Broken Hearted,"Only brokenhearted, life's not over  
I can start again  
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted  
Its a hurting, thing to get over  
  
I'm young but I'm wise enough to know  
That you don't fall in love overnight  
That's why I thought if I took my time  
That everything in love would be right  
Oh, oh  
  
But as soon as I closed my eyes  
I was saying to love ""good-bye""  
  
[Chorus]  
But I guess I'm only brokenhearted  
Life's not over I can start again  
While I'm lonely brokenhearted  
Its a hurting thing to get over  
  
No more empty conversations  
Next time I will be totally sure, oh  
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love  
Its more than my poor heart should endure  
  
So I'll listen to all advice  
And remember each time I cry  
  
Chorus  
  
Da, da, da, da, da-ha whoa.  
  
Chorus  
  
Think about you all the time  
  
Never thought Id be alone again  
That's why I asked you to be my best friend  
You know you're always on my mind  
Think about you all the time  
  
You know what I'm saying?  
  
Oh baby

57453,You Am I,Weeds,"Well who'd of thought and who could know?  
That time was ever gonna go this darn slow  
And she's late and you just don't know  
If you're ever gonna get on through this year alone  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if its gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
And he's a fake yeah  
From his smile to the tatts right there on his toes  
But you're just not sure if you're ever  
Gonna get through this year alone  
He don't hold your hand just when you need  
And you're sure that twinkle in his eye  
Ain't just there for you  
but you can't ignore that  
He sure looks like your dad  
When can still look straight at night  
When he tucks you in and kisses your belly  
And strokes your hair so you just don't cry  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
You sure wish you knew who was on the halfback flank  
About twenty years  
When you took those flags onback to back  
Would sure make the stand offs and make more sense  
If you could stand toe to toe  
And who took the bench  
But not this silent treatment  
That leaves you wondering if this baby's heaven sent  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if it's gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know that you can never sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow

To strip you down  
And have their fun

Exactly what they want you to

For wanting you  
You look good  
And they need something to do  
Until I look at you  
And then I condemn them  
I know my kind  
What goes on in our minds

It should be better  
It's just a question of time  
It should be better with you

I wonder if I'll make it  
I love the feeling when the magic is just right  
There's no revealing what is hidden in the night

No one else to blame and I can't let go  
In the darkness I can feel  
The things that makes me crazy  
Hands of madness cold as steel  
I find it quite amazing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow  
Riding on a train that I can't control  
No one else to blame and I can't let go  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
I'm riding on a train that I can't control  
See no evil, fear no fright  
Never lose the living  
Keep the targets in your sight  
Know the cards you're dealing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let, I gotta it go

But the fire was burning still  
The blinding light  
The family ghost had risen again...the ghost  
  
Don't be scared, don't be scared now my friend  
I am count de lafey  
Let me take you to the crypt down below  
Where Abigail rests  
  
Let Miriam sleep  
She never would understand  
Now come let us go... it's time to know  
  
Beware of the slippery stairs  
You could easily fall and break your neck  
Hand me that torch and I will lead the way  
To the secret in the dark  
  
Take a look into the vault, the vault  
The sarcophagus...of a child  
Abigail has been in here for years and years  
Stillborn, born... born... born  
  
The spirit of Abigail is inside your wife  
And there's only one way you can stop  
The rebirth of evil itself  
You must take her life now

30514,Drake,Unstoppable,"My name is Drizzy  
And I ain't perfect  
But I work hard  
So I deserve it  
And I belong right where you see me  
I ain't on the fence about it  
I ain't Mr. Feeny  
Naw, I got a decent set of manners  
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner  
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour  
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and  
Live like Princess Diana  
So often they have addictions and  
I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed  
I don't really understand it  
I'm not sure I'm comprehending it  
But these girls are having fun with  
Whoevers money they spending screaming  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
I got to be unstoppable  
I got to be unstoppable  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie

You don't lie

And I work harder than hardworking bizarre circus  
That's when my bars surface  
Therefore, I act a clown  
Even when I'm laying on my back,  
I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop  
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop  
She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist  
Hoe just text me

All I got is one dick

Ready to call it quits from all this shit

I'm second guessing all this negative energy  
It's making me realize why niggas really envy me  
I feel no sympathy it's tight ill  
Plus I get slight chills when I write wills  
Tired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills  
No tellin' what I might feel about my glory  
2 sides to every story  
That's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me  
The more the pain the more the game come with this territory  
I might dispose feelin' like my life been chose  
All I know in my life lotta ice and hoes  
When it's on

"
9595,John Prine,John Prine Christmas,"Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""  
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

33487,Genesis,Stagnation,"To Thomas S.Eiselberg, a very rich man, who was wise  
Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself  
Many miles beneath the ground. as the only surviving  
Member of the human race, he inherited the whole world.  
  
Stagnation  
  
Here today the red sky tells his tale,  
But the only listening eyes are mine  
There is peace amongst the hills,  
And the night will cover all my pride.  
Blest are they who smile from bodies free,  
Seems to me like any other crowd  
Who are waiting to be saved.  
  
Wait, there is still time for washing in the pool,  
Wash away the past  
Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above,  
Smiling at my tears.  
Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home,  
Keep outside the night.  
The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead,  
Somehow  
  
And each will find a home,  
And there will still be time,  
For loving my friend  
You are there  
And will I wait for ever, beside the silent mirror  
And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds  
And slimy water.  
  
I want to sit down.  
I want to take a drink of water  
I want a drink  
I want a drink.  
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat.  
I want a drink.  
I want a drink.  
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts.  
I want a drink.  
  
Then let us drink  
Then let us smile  
Then let us go

Tu attends,  
Et je tombe  
Dans tes ailes blanches, la-la-la...  
Et je vole,  
Et je coule  
Comme une plume.  
  
Si les grands yeux de mon Dieu  
Ne me gardaient pas,  
Je te volerais  
  
Ne t'enfuis pas!  
Tu as des ailes,  
Le pouvoir de me quitter.  
Tu es tombe - You fell

Que le ciel  
Te reprenne.

And I'm afraid  
That the sky  
Will take you back.

9777,Joni Mitchell,The Silky Veils Of Ardor,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger  
Traveling through all these highs and lows  
I heard there was no sickness  
And no toil or danger  
Just mercy and plenty  
Where peaceful waters flow  
Where peaceful waters flow  
  
Come all you fair and tender school girls  
Be careful now--when you court young men  
They are like the stars  
On a summer morning  
They sparkle up the night  
And they're gone again  
Daybreak, gone again  
  
If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor  
What a killing crime this love can be  
I would have locked up my heart  
In a golden sheath of armor  
And kept its crazy beating  
Under strictest secrecy  
High security  
  
I wish I had the wings  
Of Noah's pretty little white dove  
So I could fly this raging river  
To reach the one I love  
But I have no wings  
And the water is so wide  
We'll have to row a little harder  
It's just in dreams we fly  
In my dreams we fly!

You're every song I ever sing  
Summer, winter, autumn and spring  
  
And were there more than twenty four hours a day  
They'd be spent in sweet content, dreamin' away  
  
When skies are gray, skies are blue  
Morning, noon and night time too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
When skies are gray, skies are blue

No silhouette, but a light left on  
Burning there for love  
smoke is rising from the fire  
Coming out my back door  
I'm inside, sound asleep  
Cigarette on the floor  
Burning there for love  
well I can still remember  
A couple of years ago  
When the smoke and flame called my name  
It was a burning house of love  
that rusty nail over our front door  
Is where I hung our tears in the rain  
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds  
To see what luck can bring  
cause you're in your bed, I'm in mine  
On either side of town  
I think I might take a ride  
And burn your love house down

5150,Engelbert Humperdinck,A Night To Remember,"This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams  
In warm reds and greens  
And a star that keeps shining above  
Christmas Eve  
  
Children, Santa, mistletoe and moonlight.  
A feeling of joy everywhere  
And the song in the night  
Being sung clear and bright  
Is a moment for lovers to share  
  
This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams  
In warm reds and greens  
And a star that keeps shining above

Laughter, holly, snowflakes and sleigh bells  
Dreamers who travel the skies  
As we sail on the glow  
Of a fire burning glow  
There's a lifetime of love in your eyes  
  
This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams

10929,Kris Kristofferson,Best Of All Possible Worlds,"I was runnin' through the summer rain, try'n' to catch that evenin' train  
And kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain  
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didn't see  
That police man said, ""Mister Cool, if you ain't drunk, then you're a  
fool.""  
I said, ""If that's against the law, then tell me why I never saw  
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as  
me?""  
Well, that was when someone turned out the lights  
And I wound up in jail to spend the night  
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds.  
Well, I woke up next mornin' feelin' like my head was gone  
And like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong  
And I told that man I'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that  
old cell.  
That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy  
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,  
""If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""  
I said, ""I knew there was something I liked about this town.""  
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down.  
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds  
Well, they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free  
And I'd be leavin' town if I knew what was good for me  
I said, ""It's nice to learn that ev'rybody's so concerned about my  
health.""  
(They were obsessed with it)  
I said, ""I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I can  
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand  
And I don't need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin'  
else.""  
'Cause there's still a lot of drinks that I ain't drunk  
And lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk  
And lord there's still so many lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds.

But to love her is to need her

It's all I can do to just think straight.  
A little voice in my head is saying not so fast.  
If you really want this love to last.

I'm gonna catch my breath.  
I'm gonna count to ten.  
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' when you'll see me again.

And leave you with the strongest feeling there is.  
I'll give you something to miss.

And the birthday boy is there

Why don't you live up there?  
Why don't you do what I do,  
See what I feel when I care?

And the seats are naugahide  
I've been waiting for an hour  
I can't find a place to hide  
The being known as wondergirl  
Is speaking, I believe  
It's not easy trying to tell her  
That I shortly have to leave  
  
Why don't you be like me?  
Why don't you stop and see?  
Why don't you hate who I hate,  
Kill who I kill to be free?  
  
Why don't you cut your hair?  
Why don't you live up there?  
Why dodn't you do what I do,

From bainmaries to cold tea

There's a poison in my drink  
It's gonna take each good thought I could think

43700,Michael Buble,Try A Little Tenderness,"I may get weary  
Women do get weary  
Wearing the same shabby dress  
But to one who's weary  
Try a little tenderness  
  
She may be waiting  
Just anticipating  
All of the things  
She may never possess  
But while she's waiting  
Try a little tenderness  
  
I may be sentimental  
But I've had my griefs  
And my cares  
And just a good word  
Soft and gentle  
Makes it, makes it  
So much easier to bear  
  
She might forget it  
Oh but don't let her forget it  
Love's got a whole  
A whole happiness  
'cause it's so easy  
Try a little tenderness  
  
Oh it's so very easy  
It's so very easy  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
  
Try a little, try a little  
Won't you  
'cause it's so very easy  
So very easy  
Won't you try  
Yes, I'll try  
Try a little tender -  
Tender -  
-ness  
I'll try a little tenderness

16229,Pogues,The Old Main Drag,"When I first came to London I was only sixteen  
With a fiver in my pocket and my ole dancing bag  
I went down to the dilly to check out the scene  
And i soon ended up on the old main drag  
  
There the he-males and the she-males paraded in style  
And the old man with the money would flash you a smile  
In the dark of an alley you'd work for a fiver  
For a swift one off the wrist down on the old main drag  
  
In the cold winter nights the old town it was chill  
But there were boys in the cafes who'd give you cheap pills  
If you didn't have the money you'd cajole or you'd beg  
There was always lots of tuinol on the old main drag  
  
One evening as I was lying down by leicester square  
I was picked up by the coppers and kicked in the balls  
Between the metal doors at vine street I was beaten and mauled  
And they ruined my good looks for the old main drag  
  
In the tube station the old ones who were on the way out  
Would dribble and vomit and grovel and shout  
And the coppers would come along and push them about  
And I wished I could escape from the old main drag  
  
And now I'm lying here I've had too much booze  
I've been shat on and spat on and raped and abused  
I know that I am dying and I wish I could beg  
For some money to take me from the old main drag

31862,Erik Santos,Say You'll Never Go,"How can I make it through the day  
Without you  
You have been so much a part of me (and if you'll go)  
I'll never know what to do  
  
How can I carry on my way  
The memories  
When all that is left is the pain in my history  
Why should I live my life today  
  
[Refrain]  
I can't live out on my own (I can't do anything at all)  
And just forget the love you've always shown  
And accept the fate of my condition  
Please don't ever go  
For I cannot live my life alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go out my way  
Say you'll never go  
For we can still go on  
And make it through  
Just say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go away  
  
How can I make my dreams come true  
Without you  
You were the one who gave love to me (and don't you know)  
Your are my fantasy

25273,Billie Holiday,He's Funny That Way,"Never had nothing  
No one to care  
That's why I seem to have  
More than my share  
I ve got a man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
When I hurt his feelings  
Once in a while  
His only answer is one little smile  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
I can see no other way  
And no better plan  
End it all and let him go  
To some better gal  
But I'm only human  
A coward at best  
I'm more than certain  
He'd follow me West  
  
Though he loves to work  
And slave for me everyday  
He'd be so much better off  
If I went away  
But why should I leave him  
He'd be unhappy without me I know  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way

41743,Linkin Park,Blackout,"I'm stuck in this bed you made  
Alone with a sinking feeling  
I saw through the words you said  
To the secrets you've been keeping  
It's written upon your face  
All the lies how they cut so deeply  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and never say  
  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down black out blood in your eye  
  
You say that it's not your fault  
And swear that I am mistaken  
You said it's not what it seems  
No remorse for the trust you're breaking  
You run but then back you fall  
Suffocate in the mess you're making  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and take and take  
Fuck it are you listening?  
  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down

No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
Black out blood in your eye  
  
Floating down, as colors fill the light  
We look up from the ground  
In fields of paper white  
And floating up you pass us in the night  
A future gazing out a past to overwrite  
So come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect the things you know  
Come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go  
  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down

Come down

Come down

29836,Dire Straits,It Never Rains,"I hear the seven deadly sins  
And the terrible twins came to call on you  
The bigger they are babe  
The harder they fall on you  
And you you're always the same you persevere  
On the same old pleasure ground  
Oh and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
You had no more volunteers  
So you got profiteers for to help you out  
With friends like that babe  
Good friends you had to do without  
And now they've taken the chains and the gears  
From off your merry-go-round  
Oh and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
And your new romeo  
Was just a gigolo when he let you down  
See the faster they are babe  
The faster they get out of town  
Leaving make up stains and the tears  
Of a clown  
Yes and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
Oh you were just a roller coaster memory  
I don't know why I was even passing through  
I saw you making a date with destiny  
When he came around here asking after you  
In the shadow of the wheel of fortune  
You're busy trying to clear your name  
You say 'i may be guilty yeah that may be true  
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame  
See we could have been major contenders  
We never got no money no breaks'  
You've got a list of all the major offenders  
You got a list of all their major mistakes  
And he's just standing on the shadows  
Yes and you smile that come-on smile  
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day  
'I'd like to make it worth your while'  
  
Ah but it's a sad reminder  
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent  
And all you've got to give him  
Is the use of your side-show tent  
Yes and that's all that remains of the years  
Spent doing to rounds  
And it never rains around here  
Well it just comes pouring down  
  
Now you know what they say about beggars  
You can't complain about the rules  
You know what they say about beggars  
You know who's the first to blame his tools  
You never gave a damn about who you pick up  
And leave lying bleeding on the ground  
You screw people over on the way up  
Because you thought that you were never coming down  
And he takes you out in vaudeville valley  
With his hand up smothering your screams  
And he screws you down in tin pan alley  
In the city of a billion dreams

With no time for rest

Born the king of angels

Son of Mary  
Son of love

In a bar we knew way back when -  
Drinkin' sloe gin  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin  
  
Oh then the band played ""Goodnight, Sweetheart""  
One more dance and we were ready to go.  
From the spark heel boppin'  
To the light of a steamed window.  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
With them smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill ain't never gone.  
  
Then I woke up in the dark to a different sound  
That was coming from my radio  
They were playin' somethin' else  
'sides ""Go, Johnny, Go Go Go""  
  
So I turned to my sweetie, said ""Roll over, Honey  
'Cause your mama's gonna show you some fun.""  
I said ""Roll over, Honey, cause  
The thrill ain't never gone.""  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
Those smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill is never gone.

It's just a coincidence  
When the road split, it was sudden  
Hurry me to the seventh floor, please  
The elevator is unusually small  
But no one else is here, so I feel safe  
Set me free from ""thoughtfulness""  
Oh no, everything's a parody  
But to everyone, it's a true story  
Without putting any strength into it  
You pretend that you don't need anything

But they do nothing but argue  
Without putting much priority on it  
I'll read the rest of it from now

everyday life'

Soon they'll disappear  
Alone I sit in darkness  
Hoping someone might come near  
Though I wait, though I try  
No one ever comes  
And the feeling that I have flood over me  
The river starts to run  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
  
Every place you run to, everywhere you turn  
There are places that you know you should not go  
But some bridges just won't burn  
All my life, though I try  
I cannot change the past  
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you  
Make you realize at last  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
My heart is racing much faster now  
Life passes before my eyes  
Something's I see, they make me smile  
Something's they make me cry  
So I look, so I try to find  
A lesson I can learn  
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind  
And the ghosts I know return  
  
You know we fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
We fly so close, you and I sometimes  
Sometimes we fly so close,  
We'll never know how many times  
We fly so close  
We fly so close

Before you know where you are you're a slave to the green gold.  
Money talks and we're the living proof  
There ain't no limit to what money can do.  
Money talks you out of your self-respect,  
The more you crave it the cheaper you get.  
Money talks, money talks.  
  
Money buys you time and people listen,  
Money can buy a smile and make life worth living.  
If you're ugly money can improve you.  
I just couldn't face the world without mazuma.  
Money talks, money talks

13743,Neil Diamond,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain  
Is blowing in your face  
And the whole world  
Is on your case  
I could offer you  
A warm embrace  
To make you feel my love  
  
When the evening shadows  
And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you haven't made  
Your mind up yet  
But I would never  
Do you wrong  
I've known it from  
The moment that we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
I'd go hungry,  
I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling down  
The avenue  
There's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rollin' sea  
And on the highway of regret  
The winds of change  
Are blowing wild and free  
You ain't seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy,  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldn't do  
Go to the ends of the earth  
For you  
To make you feel my love

Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,

How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?  
No eye communication always happens that way.  
  
I know I shouldn't let it happen,  
There's no excuse, I felt so alone.  
You know how it is, our lure was meant to trap them,  
And then they find some poison of their own.

No eye communication, always happens this way.  
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?

Hanging within the balance

Darkness' power to hold us  
Once for all time  
Choosing to die  
I'll never deserve you

My fists held high and I clenched my teeth  
But I'd wake up to the same old me, oh  
I was living a lie, but you brought me truth  
Afraid to cry, but you taught me to  
You stood beside me, now I'll stand by you, oh  
  
I was over the edge, I was always out of my head  
I wasn't foolin' anyone, playin' with a loaded gun  
Oh-oh, over the edge, I wouldn't listen to what anybody said  
I was numbing all the pain, you taught me how to feel again  
  
If I had died, it would have been a shame  
They'd have said ""he only had himself to blame""  
You saved my life when you called my name, oh  
  
I was over the edge, I was always out of my head  
I was numbing all the pain, you showed me how to feel again  
Oh-oh, over the edge, I wouldn't listen to what anybody said

30584,Dusty Springfield,A Song For You,"I've been so many places  
In my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs  
I made some bad rhymes  
  
I've acted out my life in stages  
Ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me  
Is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly  
But, darling, can't you see  
There's no one more important to me?  
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?  
'Cause we're alone now, and  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth, withholding nothing  
You came out in front, I was hiding  
Oh, but now I'm so much better  
If the words don't come together  
Just listen to the melody  
'Cause my love's in there hiding  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh, I love you in a place  
Where there's no space or time  
Love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and  
I was singing this song for you  
We were alone  
I was singing this song for you, oh  
Singing  
I was singing, singing, singing, singing, singing this song for you  
Oh, yes  
Singing this song for you

23901,America,Sandman,"Ain't it foggy outside  
All the planes have been grounded  
Ain't the fire inside?  
Let's all go stand around it  
  
Funny I've been there  
And you've been here  
We ain't had no time to drink that beer  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I understand  
You've been running from the man  
That goes by the name of the Sandman  
He flies the sky  
Like an eagle in the eye of a hurricane that's abandoned  
  
Ain't the years gone by fast  
I supposed you have missed them  
Oh, I almost forgot to ask  
Did you hear of my enlistment?

35751,Helloween,Nothing To Say,"When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice  
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice  
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say  
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way  
  
And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds  
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got  
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share  
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Right in our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
You called me up the other day just when I thought you would  
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good  
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease  
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece  
  
That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree  
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be  
  
'Cause it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test  
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest  
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place  
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Thereof our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
I got  
I got nothing to say  
I got nothing  
Nothing to say  
  
I got way  
I still brave horizon  
Nothing to spilled  
Long long way  
Nothing to say

Yeah yeah yeah..  
Historical and monumental shit  
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball  
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall  
Niggas play hard and shit, if you know what's best for you  
Why y'all niggas better safeguard your shit  
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap  
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap  
Street niggas now the corporate boss  
Still go to why y'all restaurant for steamed fish and Irish moss  
And why-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb  
Your whole show wack and I'ma cancel your sitcom  
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm  
You ain't knowing my name tattooed on your bitch arm  
The way we blow shit is a shame  
Casually bust my gun and celebrate busting a cork on the champagne  
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas  
Why'all should know I only ball like a coach, now!

Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous

Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord  
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established  
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry  
S-5, blowin through Asbury  
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand  
Them them niggas, robbing from Pinkhouse's  
Show and prove, knocking off cab drivers  
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand  
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem  
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses  
Limousine, automatic new Uzi's in 'em yo  
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him

Move up the block, giant box blast my song  
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on  
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias  
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris  
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in  
Some assuming they paid dues and joined the union  
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle  
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble  
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed  
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed  
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant  
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments  
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise  
Starlight scope, with the night vision device  
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice  
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice

Peanuts in a bottle  
At ten, two and four  
A fried bologna sandwich  
With mayo and tomato  
Sittin' round the table  
Don't happen much anymore  
  
We got too complicated  
It's all way over-rated  
I like the old and out-dated  
Way of life  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And crack's what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw  
The wind was all that blew  
And when you said I'm down with that  
Well it meant you had the flu  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
  
I love my records  
Black, shiny vinyl  
Clicks and pops  
And white noise  
Man they sounded fine  
I had my favorite stations  
The ones that played them all  
Country, soul and rock-and-roll  
What happened to those times?  
  
I'm readin' 'Street Slang For Dummies'  
'Cause they put pop in my country  
I want more for my money  
The way it was back then  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And crack's what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw  
The wind was all that blew  
And when you said I'm down with that  
Well it meant you had the flu  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
  
Give me a flat top for strumming  
I want the whole world to be humming  
Just keep it coming  
The way it was back then  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And crack's what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw

Suck stout through me nose  
And where it's gonna end

The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
I have often had to depend upon  
The kindness of strangers  
But I've never been asked and I never replied  
If I supported the Glasgow Rangers  
And down all the days

And questionize my  
  
Strong denial

Piercing through my brain  
  
Windows illuminating stains  
Breakdown closing in again  
Free fall as I close my eyes  
Voices talking many lies  
  
Changing my course  
Blurred and scorched  
Breathing exhaust  
As we distort  
  
By gravity  
  
Of such G-force  
  
Bullet bullet train  
Piercing through my brain  
  
Breakdown close my eyes  
Voices talking many lies  
Stained glass bursting in  
Shattering my world again  
Free fall but never can  
Ever reach the ground again  
Dark eyes scanning in  
Feel my mind explode within  
  
Wanting much more  
I implore you  
Near to death's door  
To ignore  
  
The screams of all  
  
Who fall before

Piercing through my brain

To analyze the soil

A couple was rubbing against us  
Rubbing and doing that new dance  
The man was wearing a jacket and jeans  
The woman was laughing in advance

Gets wound around a heart. Pull it  
  
Tighter and tighter  
Until the muddy waters part  
Down by the river bank  
A blues band arrives  
The music suffers  
The music business thrives

believe me if all those endearing young charms  
Which I gave on so fondly today  
Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms  
Like the fairy gifts fading away  
Though would still be adored as this moment thou art  
Let thy loveliness fade as it will  
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart  
Would entwine itself verdantly still  
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own  
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear  
That the fervour and faith of a soul can be known  
To which time will but make thee more dear  
No the heart which has truly loved never forgets  
But as truly loves on to the close  
As the sunflower turns on her guard when he sets  
The same look which she turned when he rose

26035,Bob Seger,Night Moves,"I was a little too tall  
Could've used a few pounds  
Tight pants points hardly reknown  
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes  
And points all her own sitting way up high  
Way up firm and high  
  
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy  
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy  
Workin' on mysteries without any clues  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news  
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime  
In the sweet summertime  
  
We weren't in love oh no far from it  
We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit  
We were just young and restless and bored  
Living by the sword  
And we'd steal away every chance we could  
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods  
I used her she used me  
But neither one cared  
We were getting our share  
  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues  
Workin' on out night moves  
In the summertime  
And oh the wonder  
Felt the lightning  
And we waited on the thunder  
Waited on the thunder  
  
I woke last night to the sound of thunder  
How far off I sat and wondered  
Started humming a song from 1962  
Ain't it funny how the night moves  
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose  
Strange how the night moves  
With autumn closing in

And then she slides in and she gives you the green light

1971  
I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car  
He don't wear no fancy clothes  
He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

All you say is sacred to me  
Your eyes are so blue  
I can't look away  
As we lay in the stillness  
You whisper to me  
  
Amy, marry me  
Promise you'll stay with me  
Oh you don't have to ask me  
You know you're all that I live for  
You know I'd die just to hold you  
Stay with you  
Somehow I'll show you  
That you are my night sky  
I've always been right behind you  
Now I'll always be right beside you  
  
So many nights I cried myself to sleep  
Now that you love me, I love myself  
I never thought I would say this  
I never thought there'd be  
You

22986,Adele,That's It I Quit I'm Movin' On,"When we used  
To say goodnight  
I'd always kiss  
And hold you tight  
But lately  
You don't seem  
To care  
You close the door  
And leave me  
Standing there  
Oh, honey  
That's not fair  
That's it  
I quit  
I'm movin' on  
  
The other night  
We had a date  
An you showed up  
Two hours late  
And though your hair  
Was all in place  
Somebody smeared  
Their lipstick  
On your face  
Yeah she smeared it  
Every place  
Ye that's it honey  
I quit I'm movin' on  
  
Oooohhhh  
  
You made me want you  
You made me leave you  
You made me tumble  
And fall  
But if I  
Can't have you the way  
I want you  
I don't want you at all  
  
Baby, I can take a lot  
Cause I love  
Everything you got  
Though your kisses  
Fill me  
So if you got  
Someone else  
I gotta go  
Oh, that you know  
Yeah that's it honey  
I quit I'm movin' on

I quit now  
Oh I'm movin' on

46676,Oliver,Young Birds Fly,"""What's gone wrong with Mary?""  
I hear them say  
Mary's not the Mary of yesterday  
She's gone to changin' her hair  
And she laughs and she cries  
And her life seems to be  
Such a worried and jumbled affair  
  
Well, I have talked to Mary  
I've searched her eyes  
And if you ask of Mary  
I'll tell you why  
It's Mary's time to run  
Through the mad, through the sane,  
Through the joy and the pain  
'Til she finds her place in the sun  
  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
And each song they know  
Can help them to grow  
  
Mary questions everything  
She's ever known before  
And want her as we may  
She just won't listen anymore  
But let her find a way  
And soon'll come a glorious day  
When everything's been sorted through  
The streets will be reported  
How people congregate to feel the love within her heart  
And to listen to the music in her mind  
  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
Young birds fly in early spring  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
Young birds fly in early spring  
  
(Young birds fly in early spring  
Oh oh oh oh  
Young birds fly in early spring)  
  
Young birds go on and fly away  
Fly  
Go on and fly  
Fly away

Tired you need a lift  
You feel on the brink  
Maybe you need new tits  
  
Vulnerable as a ship  
But you re not on the sea  
Can you talk to anyone here?  
No, not really  
  
And the crowd stays on your back  
And the girls are all s0 stacked  
And the stress it lines your face  
And you really need a place  
  
Its just that social life  
Its got you on the run  
That goddamn social life  
It's torture dressed as fun  
It's just that social life  
They got you seeing things  
That goddamn social life  
And now you re chasing strings  
That goddamn social life  
  
God-awful art and clothes  
Plenty of money, though  
You guess it must be worth something  
What that would be you don' t know  
In your imagination  
There's a face of love  
  
Someone who will come along  
Instead of coming on  
  
Anp the forces ebb and flow  
And the money goes and goes  
And something makes you  
Want to throw a brick  
Through the window  
  
It's just that social life  
It's got you on the run  
That goddamn social life  
It's torture dressed as fun  
It's just that social life  
They got you chasing strings  
That goddamn social life  
And you are seeing things

Believe you were alone?  
You say that spiders crawled inside  
And made themselves a home  
Where light once was.  
  
Petrified of who you are and  
Who you have become.  
You will hide from everyone,  
Denying you need someone  
To exterminate your bones.

Friend, please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me.  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend, please don't take your life away from me.

By everyone you know.  
You say that you're fine but  
You have lost your sway a glow.  
So I stopped by to let you know.

Would you let me know your plans tonight?  
'Cause I just won't let go till we both see the light.  
And I have nothing else left to say.

55643,Waterboys,The Whole Of The Moon,"I pictured a rainbow  
You held it in your hands  
I had flashes  
But you saw the plan  
I wandered out in the world for years  
While you just stayed in your room  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon  
  
You were there in the turnstiles  
With the wind at your heels  
You stretched for the stars  
And you know how it feels  
To reach too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
  
I was grounded  
While you filled the skies  
I was dumbfounded by truth  
You cut through lies  
  
I saw the rain dirty valley  
You saw Brigadoon  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon!  
  
I spoke about wings  
You just flew  
I wondered I guessed and I tried  
You just knew  
I sighed  
... but you swooned!  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
With a torch in your pocket  
And the wind at your heels  
You climbed on the ladder  
And you know how it feels  
To get too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
Unicorns and cannonballs  
Palaces and piers  
Trumpets towers and tenements  
Wide oceans full of tears  
Flags rags ferryboats  
Scimitars and scarves  
Every precious dream and vision  
Underneath the stars  
  
Yes you climbed on the ladder  
With the wind in your sails  
You came like a comet  
Blazing your trail  
Too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon

42875,Marillion,Grendel,"Midnight suns bid moors farewell, retreats from charging dusk  
Mountain echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks  
They place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight  
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea  
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams  
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame  
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere  
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear  
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify  
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew  
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through  
Mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf and stream  
An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams  
The shaper's lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp  
Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart  
  
Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell  
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell  
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife  
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries  
  
Screams are his music, lightning his guide  
Raping the darkness, death by his side  
  
Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams  
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene  
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe  
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know  
  
Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave  
Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the
brave  
  
So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out  
You should have known better after all this time  
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander  
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes  
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame  
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame  
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame  
  
So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws  
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives  
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot  
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods  
  
Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand  
You call for justice and distort the truth  
Well I've had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches  
Receive your punishment, Expose your throats to my righteous claws  
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, flow, flow, flow.

All I want for christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth see my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you a merry christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Sissel sitting on a sissel  
Every time I try to speak  
All I do is a whistle

Good old Santa and his reindeer  
They used to bring me lots of toys and candy  
I call for hamster ramster honnor and blitzer  
None of them can understand me

3746,David Bowie,1984,"Someday they won't let you, so now you must agree  
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free  
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air  
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care  
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
Come see, come see, remember me?  
We played out an all night movie role  
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled  
In 1984 (who could ask for more)  
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)  
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)  
  
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride  
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side  
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
Come see, come see, remember me?  
We played out an all night movie role

She's a warm and a wonderful friend  
Of taverns and gershwin and a world  
We woo till we end

Could no one love you more so much more than me  
My piano is my endless song  
Such a warm and a faithful melody  
And oh all the tears we cried and we've dried just you and me  
Hey old gal may I ask you

48434,Pink Floyd,Echoes,"Overhead the albatross  
Hangs motionless upon the air  
And deep beneath the rolling waves  
In labyrinths of coral caves  
An echo of a distant time  
Comes willowing across the sand  
And everything is green and submarine.  
  
And no one called us to the land  
And no one knows the where's or why's.  
Something stirs and something tries  
Starts to climb toward the light.  
  
Strangers passing in the street  
By chance two separate glances meet  
And I am you and what I see is me.  
And do I take you by the hand  
And lead you through the land  
And help me understand  
The best I can.  
  
And no one called us to move on,  
And no one forces down our eyes.  
No one speaks and no one tries  
No one flies around the sun  
  
Cloudless everyday you fall  
Upon my waking eyes,  
Inviting and inciting me  
To rise.  
And through the window in the wall  
Come streaming in on sunlight wings  
A million bright ambassadors of morning.  
  
And no one sings me lullabys  
And no one makes me close my eyes  
So I throw the windows wide  
And call to you across the sky

29794,Diana Ross,It's Hard For Me To Say,"Didn't know 'till today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of the things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that  
You would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't often say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in my heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
Kind of sad, kind of blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you are in my heart  
Though we are far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
It's hard for me

Oh so thank your lucky stars we've got protection  
Walk the line and never mind the cost  
And no wonder who them lawmen were protecting  
When they nailed the Saviour to the cross

We don't need no little speaking prophets  
Scaring decent folks like you and me no siree

33604,George Harrison,Sat Singing,"Sitting as the noonday sun  
Shines high up in a clear blue sky.  
While warming me I drift away  
No mem'ries of the times gone by.  
Oh, the moment that I lose my mind,  
You come into my heart and say  
I'm always here for you to love,  
Surrender to me, let me stay- ay- ay.

Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
  
Sinking deeper still inside,  
I feel awakened from my dreams.  
Resting in some golden flow,  
Becoming part of you it seems.  
  
Nothing separates my life  
From that which we have called our goal,  
It's all in this external world  
As results from deep within my soul-oul-oul.  
Oo-oo  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
  
As I open up my eyes,  
The sky has changed into a glow.  
My sense of time had disappeared,  
I see the sun has sunken low.  
  
I feel such joy and call your name,  
You're ev'rything my eyes could see.  
I'll gladly kiss it all goodbye,  
Stay ever in your company-ny-ny.

Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a word to start me out.  
The rest will come without a doubt  
I'm going downstairs to write a book  
Got a great idea's gonna really cook  
A rattling good yarn with an ironic twist  
A riveting ending that's not to be missed  
Makesure the presses are ready to steam  
This book is a scorcher, a publisher's dream  
Just the first part's all I need  
The rest will come with lightning speed  
Just a line to set the stage.  
My pen will dance across the page  
I'm going downstairs to write a play  
Got a great idea gonna make it pay  
This serious drama won't be understood  
The critics will love it and say that it's good

29183,Death,To Forgive Is To Suffer,"Throughout our time a thought  
Escapes us to enforce a word, no  
Holding on to pain it may seem to some  
  
The easy way to say o.k., twist your  
Knife a little deeper  
Words to sharp actions dark  
Hide the blade of the deceiver.  
  
Enforce the words no more, be free  
Alone you might just find serenity.  
  
To accept another day we choose  
To give away another piece of life  
To forgive is to suffer  
  
Once or twice is kind  
Three or four is blind  
It is not the end yet a way to begin  
The power of words both good and bad.

52958,The Broadways,Into The Woods - Moments In The Woods,"  
Was that me?  
Was that him?  
Did a Prince really kiss me?  
And kiss me?  
And kiss me?  
And did I kiss him back?  
  
Was it wrong?  
Am I mad?  
Is that all?  
Does he miss me?  
Was he suddenly  
Getting bored with me?  
  
Wake up! Stop dreaming.  
Stop prancing about the woods.  
It's not besseming.  
What is it about the woods?  
  
Back to life, back to sense,  
Back to child, back to husband,  
No one lives in the woods,  
There are vows, there are ties,  
There are needs, there are standards,  
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds.  
  
Why not both instead?  
There's the answer, if you're clever:  
Have a child for warmth,  
And a Baker for bread,  
And a Prince for whatever-  
Never!  
It's these woods.  
  
Face the facts, find the boy,  
Join the group, stop the Giant-  
Just get out of these woods.  
Was that him? yes it was.  
Was that me? No it wasn't,  
Just a trick of the woods.  
  
Just a moment,  
One peculiar passing moment...  
Must it all be either less or more,  
Either plain or grand?  
Is it always ""or""?  
Is it never ""and""?  
That's what woods are for:  
For those moments in the woods...  
  
Oh. if life were made of moments,  
Even now and then a bad one-!  
But if life were only moments,  
Then you'd never know you had one.  
  
First a Witch, then a child,  
Then a Prince, then a moment-  
Who can live in the woods?  
And to get what you wish,  
Only just for a moment-  
These are dangerous woods...  
  
Let the moment go...  
Don't forget it for a moment, though.  
Just remembering you've had and ""and"",  
When you're back to ""or"",  
Makes the ""or"" mean more  
Than it did before.  
Now I understand-  
  
And it's time to leave the woods.

They had that special grace  
That special spirit that says give me a challenge  
And I'll meet it with joy  
  
The crew of the space shuttle challenger  
Honored us in the manner  
Of which they lived their lives  
We will never forget them  
As they prepared for their journey  
And waved goodbye  
And they slipped the surly of earth  
To touch the face of God.

23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out  
Makin' MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out  
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out  
My temp seizing, perfect reason to blow the game out  
Skating off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me  
But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya, yeah, gladly  
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?  
Y'all want to keep going platinum, y'all don't want to disappear?  
Stop bopping backstage like you causing me fear  
Cause you starting to get on my nerves, and that's a problem  
The vet's in here

Tension on the mic, halftime highlights  
L Boogie banging on 'em, jumpin' through the skylight  
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight  
I'm just spitting, when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight  
Alright? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious  
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this  
Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous  
So, throwing your joint at my car was spontaneous  
Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it  
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked  
Forever I will be, the one they came to see  
Blowing mics in half baby, who else could it be but  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
I'm so hot (yeah)  
We so hot (yeah)  
You so hot (I'm so hot)  
Feel it hot (yeah)  
Are you hot (you make me hot)  
I know I'm hot (oh)  
Are you hot (yes I'm hot)  
I know I'm hot, feel it! (yeah)

From the desert to the mountain  
From the lowest low to the highest high

Lightens that invisible load  
Riding on a nameless quest  
Haunting that wilderness road  
Like a ghost rider  
  
Just an escape artist  
Racing against the night  
A wandering hermit  
Racing toward the light  
  
From the White Sands  
To the Canyonlands  
To the redwood stands  
To the Barren Lands  
  
Sunrise on the road behind  
Sunset on the road ahead  
There's nothing to stop you now  
Nothing can stop you now

A pebble skips across the face  
A dozen times, then disappears  
Not a trace left behind

A change of mind  
Another start a brand new day  
  
You know I'll change  
If change is what you require  
Your every wish  
Your every dream, hope, desire  
  
Here comes the mirror man  
Says he's a people fan  
Here comes the mirror man  
  
And if it seems I'm not the one you used to know  
Our little friendship left behind not long ago  
Don't feel too hurt  
As distance heals the strongest pain  
Things are much better now  
And just a nagging doubt remains  
  
You know I'll change  
If change is what you require  
Your every wish  
Your every dream, hope, desire

With a lot of life before me

Looking at the x-rays  
Talkin' 'bout the options  
And talkin' 'bout sweet time""

And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying""

To live like you were dying""

""I was finally the husband  
That most of the time I wasn't  
And I became a friend a friend would like to have  
And all of a sudden going fishin'  
Wasn't such an imposition  
And I went three times that year I lost my dad  
I finally read the Good Book, and I  
Took a good, long, hard look  
At what I'd do if I could do it all again  
And then  
  
I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying""

What did I do with it?  
What would I do with it?

We went to sleep by dialing 'o'  
We drove to work by proxy

Is runnin' to the sea  
And every spring when a flower grows  
It happens naturally  
  
The same magic when you're in my arms  
No logic can define  
Don't know why, just feels so right  
I only know it happens every time

18795,Steely Dan,Josie,"We're gonna break out the hats and hooters  
When Josie comes home  
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters  
When Josie comes home to stay  
  
We're gonna park in the street  
Sleep om the beach and make it  
Throw down the jam till the girls say when  
Lay down the law and break it  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So good  
She's the pride of the neighborhood  
She's the raw flame  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire  
  
Jo would you love to scrapple  
She'll never say no  
Shine up the battle apple  
We'll shake 'em all down tonight  
  
We're gonna mix in the street  
Strike at the stroke of midnight  
Dance on the bones till the girls say when  
Pick up what's left by daylight  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So bad  
She's the best friend we ever had  
She's the raw flame  
  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire

18446,Santana,Love,"Sufferin' night and day  
People all around me crying  
Enough--what's the use  
We don't even feel like trying  
Hatred, doubt, and fear  
It's not the way toward the solution  
There must be a way  
To be free from all illusion  
  
Love  
Oh, love  
All we need is love  
  
History loudly claims  
That we never learn our lesson  
We kill one another  
We put the blame on greed and passion  
Wise men calmly say  
Every man shall reach perfection  
If we help each other  
We will reach our destination  
  
Love  
Oh, love  
All we need is love  
  
Love  
Oh, love  
All we need is love

Will be out of sight

Until then we'll  
Have to motor through somehow  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more

Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

Now we're worlds apart  
Deep inside you know you are my other heart  
My memories seem like yesterday  
Can't believe it's all so far away  
All these years  
All our tears  
Still we sing the same old song  
Let's make right all that went wrong  
There's no beginning there's no end  
There is no reason to pretend  
Crying from help from above  
We've got to save our love  
You said to me  
That we hold the key  
Eternal love we give and take  
It was meant to be  
My love for you  
Was always true  
Still we sing the same old song  
Let's make right all that went wrong  
There's no beginning there's no end  
There is no reason to pretend  
Crying from help from above  
We've got to save our love

Of some unfortunate nation  
Didn't have no money, sure didn't have the time

He's got an ego  
That's bigger than yours and mine

A spirit breaking  
That's why I feel this way

Crave for company  
never gave me  
Any room to breathe  
  
Intuition  
Soon made me wise  
As you ran out of  
Alibis  
Took time to draw the line  
That I can't deny  
Nothing is plain or black and white  
You fight like a tired soldier  
Shielded by wounded pride  
Always pretending to be strong  
Desperately waiting for  
  
Another time, another place  
I don't care no more  
I am the one you can't replace  
A fact you can't ignore  
  
Can you face it  
I'm forever gone  
Dug your own grave  
Shot with your own gun

Loving you makes me a better man

Time after time I've been lost  
Just couldn't find my way  
  
You shed a light on the path through the night  
Leading right to the side where I stand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I make mistakes, didn't have what it takes  
Just to walk out leave it alone  
I've got a long lot of heartaches that follow me home  
  
Time goes on and I watch you disappear  
I've got a mount to mount  
Now that I have you near

There's a line that I've crossed in the sand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
Loving you makes me a better man

And maybe you're a little crazy  
And laughing out loud  
Makes it all alright

Some lag behind

Rise and then vanish

The mushroom mouth is back worse than before.(???)  
Making us snore, whining in the microphone (Baby crying)  
  
It's the return of the oh wait, no wait, you're a fool.  
You didn't pay money for this CD did you?  
And Dr. Dre (laugh) did everything you idiot, without Dre's defense you're as
good as dead.  
  
The world's had enough of Eminem (Jiggy jiggy)  
Even his girlfriend's cheatin on him.  
Look at him, walking around living off Dre, acting so cool, but he's really
kinda weak though.  
  
Little twit blasts me on his new CD  
Why? Cause I turned him down for a date (hee hee)  
As for the question of who came first, was it Carson Daly or was it Fred
Durst?  
I'm sorry Slim, but this is gonna hurt. They both came closer than you ever
will, jerk.  
  
Your song is on my nerves, your song is on my nerves.  
You're kinda lucky cause you got more fame than you deserve.  
That is the message that I deliver to little kids  
You can become famous and never know what talent is.  
  
Of course they're gonna like you, of course they do.  
You're like a cartoon version of Ricky Schroder on ""Silver Spoons""  
You ain't nothin' but a product, packaged to be bought up.  
You know a year from now you won't be thought of.  
  
So you write about dead animals and cannibals  
And some day you'll stop dating dogs and date higher mammals. (Dog howls)  
And there's a million women just like me, that think like me, that all can see
that  
Slim Shady is just a boy dealing with puberty  
So if you agree, scream loudly with me!!

Why  
Tell me...  
Why

These are the words I never said  
This is the path I'll never tread  
These are the dreams I'll dream instead  
This is the joy that's seldom spread  
These are the tears...  
The tears we shed  
This is the fear  
This is the dread  
These are the contents of my head  
And these are the years that we have spent  
And this is what they represent  
And this is how I feel  
Do you know how I feel?

I don't think you know how I feel  
I don't think you know how I feel  
You don't know what I feel

Give me your arm as we cross the street  
Call me at six on the dot  
A line a day when you're far away  
Little things mean a lot  
Don't have to buy me diamonds and pearls  
Champagne, sables and such  
I never cared much for diamonds and pearls  
But honestly honey, they just cost money  
Give me your hand when I've lost the way  
Give me your shoulder to cry on  
Whether the day is bright or gray give me your heart to rely on  
Send me the warmth of a secret smile  
To show me you haven't forgot  
Now and forever , that always and ever  
Little things mean a lot

31220,Elvis Costello,Basement Kiss,"Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road  
For in Belgravia  
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made  
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?  
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?  
  
Who's that sneaking 'round the door?  
You can't come here no more  
Can't you go home again?  
She used to sit alone for hours  
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that  
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers  
  
Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?  
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?

51915,Spandau Ballet,Lifeline,"Changing her colours she's off to the shore  
She rides the soul train and he fight the law  
There's a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure  
So live and live in love  
One day he'll build a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
This subterfuge he never really planned  
Now you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
So live and let live in love  
Exchanging their letters their exits begun  
With deathless precision he's aiming his gun  
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sun  
So live and let live in love  
Neither has the ghost of a chance  
Those decisions only can be made once  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
He could have built a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing to you  
But I'm not living

Every week, pay em all a visit  
I bring Pamela Lee to the P's so we all can dig it  
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it  
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets  
O.k, I'll rap a little faster  
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor  
I'm like you except I date supermodels  
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow  
We get the same parties probably  
My stones look like sunshine, yours probably cloudy  
And I don't front for nothin'  
I likes, I gets, I want for nothin'

Get head while I'll roast in a sauna

And gotta give the government half  
You know this brother live last  
And not even Mike seen Jordan's in the colors I have  
I used to run from under covers like Shaft  
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft  
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's body  
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties

I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first I know it starts inside of me  
If I can see it, I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

39979,Kenny Loggins,I Gotta Try,"Maybe it's true what they say about it  
Maybe we can't make the ends meet  
Maybe we'll all have to do without it  
Maybe this world's just incomplete  
Still we all look for truth in our lives  
Searching from different sides  
If it's so hard living in a desperate world  
But we all do the best that we can  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Maybe there's too much to think about  
Maybe there just ain't nothing left to say  
But if our time's really running out  
Then this is no time to run away  
'Cause we're destined to look for truth in this life  
Blinded by tearful eyes  
If it's no use trying in a desperate world  
Then tell me, why was I born?  
Some people see a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Lonely, living so lonely  
Is it too late  
To turn it all around?  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
I gotta change  
The world just remains the same  
All of us live our lives  
Under the gun  
Someone's sleeping  
Someone's giving up  
Someone's trying  
Someone's crying out  
Still we live under the gun

34570,Grease,Blue Moon,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for  
  
And then suddenly appeared before me, the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'  
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold - oh oh oh  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own

And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
Falling into somebody else's arms

I must admit that when I first laid eyes,  
you had me hypnotized  
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much  
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch

Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me  
To love and to comfort you

The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock  
Cause there's the key to unlock the body  
Place it like that to open up the door  
The door to the house full of people galore  
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks  
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks  
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot  
And believe it or not, all the troubles you forgot  
It's just that easy if you want it to be  
For all the fellas, and the young ladies  
So ease your mind and set yourself free  
To the mystifying music that we call Cindy see  
  
Oh Cindy see, won't you play with me?  
Oh Cindy see

the broken part of my machinery.  
Psychoanalyze the chapters  
on the path to my darkest day.  
Searching for the answers,  
all I see is damage through the haze.  
Picking up the pieces of my life  
with no direction for re-assembly.  
The one that lays beside me  
is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.  
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?  
Mother Mary in control,  
domineering stranglehold  
sowing destructive seeds  
for the scavengers to feed.  
Driving the nail into my head,  
memory flows like a river.  
With the one that lays beside me  
I'm healing scars from my childhood memories.  
Tomorrow finally found me.  
I'm hypnotized. I'm trying...  
to understand the chapters  
of the path from my darkest day.  
Searching for the answers  
but there's DAMAGE!

You're supposed to look into my eyes

I know there are walls we have to climb  
I sit here waiting and yearning  
'Cause I know we can get by  
  
You're supposed to look into my eyes  
Forever and all time  
You start loving me again  
And now I know that I  
I will never have to cry out  
That you and I  
We belong together again

30749,Ed Sheeran,Faces,"Faces change  
But this place'll stay the same  
And I'll know  
When I'll go  
  
Yeah  
And I'm pickin' up another bag  
And I pack another knapsack  
The airport's like a stop light to me  
Sittin' on red, green light go  
Can't see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans, some may call 'em  
And it's on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream  
I lived the life, signed a picture  
'Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block, they judge you on 'em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?  
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
I'm the  
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write  
With a broken pen, there they go again  
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam  
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in  
I'm goin' home, I'm home again  
Bring it back up in the UK  
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy, hell, you say  
I'm just bein' blunt, homie  
Keep the grass  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah, take one look  
Better yet, take two  
But if I take that break, there's a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots I've been  
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season  
'Cause I am not the reason  
That the image you're used to seein'  
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes, I'm different  
Differently made  
And me screamin' the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
It's the place I stayed  
'Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught, but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne, it was in my name  
Michael  
M.W.A  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin' out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven  
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood line's not a family tree  
It's a needle in my skin for all to see  
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly

40099,Kenny Rogers,Maybe,"Maybe, is a word that hangs between us  
It's the thing to say when all else has failed  
Maybe we failed, maybe  
Maybe, but I can't bare say it's over  
Til the love we found is hopelessly lost  
Maybe I could, maybe not.  
  
Our lives might have come unwound  
But have we've come so far  
That we can't turn the hurt around  
Our hearts still remain the same  
Oh, first to wonder why  
Oh, ask to make a change.  
  
But maybe  
Maybe, if we hold on to tomorrow  
Just hold on, just hold on  
Then we just might find a feeling again  
Not let it end.  
  
Maybe, it's a word that hangs between us  
Maybe, time would help the wondering to stop  
Maybe we will know, maybe not  
Maybe, maybe.

There was just no way this house could hold the two of us  
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind  
  
Well say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day all boys must run away  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
All men must make their way come Independence Day

Leaving their friends, their homes

Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late  
Nothing we can say can change anything now  
Because there's just different people coming down here now  
And they see things in different ways  
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away

Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say  
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day  
I swear I never meant to take those things away

It's funny to me  
How far you are but now  
Near you seem to be  
I could talk all night  
Just to hear you breathe  
I could spend my life  
Just living this dream  
You're all I'll ever need  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms  
I need you to know  
I've never been  
I've never been this close  
  
With all the lovers  
I used to know  
I kept my distance I never let go  
But in your arms I know I'm safe  
'Cause I've never been held  
And I've never been kissed in this way  
You're all I'll ever need  
You're all I'll ever need  
  
Close enough to see it's true  
Close enough to trust in you  
Closer now than any words can say  
  
And when, when I'm in your arms,  
I need you to know I've never been  
I've never been this close  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms

5642,Everclear,White Men In Black Suits,"I am just a boy working in a record store  
Yes I moved to San Francisco just to see what I could be  
I am a loser geek, crazy with an evil streak  
Yes I do believe there is a violent thing inside of me  
She is just a girl, she is doing what she can  
She dances topless  
  
When she's not playing in her band  
Such a pretty girl, happy in an ugly place  
Watching all the pretty people do lots of ugly things  
I think it's getting better for the two of us  
Yes I think it's getting better almost everyday  
I could give a damn for what those people say  
All I want to do is lose myself in your room  
All you want is just a slow fuck in the afternoon  
  
I still see those scary guys when I am all alone at night  
I kiss the ring you gave me then I swing with all my might  
I think it's getting better for the two of us  
  
I think it's getting easier for you and me to agree  
That the white men in black suits  
They are diminishing  
Yes I think they are diminishing  
Yes I think they diminish you and they diminish me  
I think they are diminishing  
  
You know sometimes I hear those people say  
Yeah she takes a bus  
  
Over to the north side of the city  
She goes to work stripping for the rich white men  
All the words they give her  
  
Make her feel so soft and pretty  
She wears them but they never seem to fit  
Yes I think it's getting better for the two of us  
Yes I think it's getting better in the worst way  
I refuse to be afraid of almost everyone  
  
Afraid of all the things they do or the words that they say  
Let's live the way we want to live and hope they go away  
I really hope they go away  
  
I really hope they find a nice place  
I hope they find it somewhere  
I hope they go away  
  
I can still hear all those people say

46855,Omd,Native Daughters Of The Golden West,"In ecstasy they cry to know  
If their parents love will let them grow  
Their mother's pride, their father's joy  
We thank the stars that they're not boys  
The native daughters of the golden west  
Their beauty is priceless  
  
As children do they stayed at home  
Waiting for the day that they were grown  
The future seemed so far away  
But every night they'd kneel and pray  
  
But all in all they did their best  
And one by one they left the nest  
Across the globe they searched for love  
And put their faith in God above  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They're made out of light  
We never would have guessed  
  
So by and by their dreams came true they fell in love with boys they knew  
Their children grew fed from the breast  
Of the native daughters of the golden west  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They talk all day  
But we were not impressed  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They're sisters of mercy  
They'll grant your last request

I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life

Only the sense of completion  
And in your eyes, I see  
The missing pieces I'm searching for  
I think I've found my way home

More than a little crazy

6626,George Harrison,Just Like A Woman,"Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Evrybody knows  
That babys got new clothes  
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls.  
She takes just like a woman  
And she makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
Queen mary, she's my friend  
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again  
Nobody has to guess  
That baby can't be blessed  
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest  
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.  
She takes just like a woman  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
It was raining from the first  
And I was dying there of thirst  
So I came in here  
And your long-time curse hurts  
But what's worse  
Is this pain in here  
I can't stay in here  
Aint it clear that  
  
That I just can't fit  
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit  
But when we meet again  
Introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
I was hungry and it was your world.  
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yeah you do and  
You make love just like a woman, yeah and  
You ache just like a woman  
But you break just like a little girl.

friends  
On a long lonesome highway in an old pickup truck  
Crossed Texas like a hot dusty wind  
He was all around cowboy back in1949 from the top it's been long way down  
Since the whiskey and the women started winnin' his time  
They rode him high and hard to the ground  
He remembers the thrill of bein' a winner in the days of his first rodeo  
But there's somethin' about winning that didn't last forever  
Maybe tomorrow things'll get better if devil lets loose of his soul  
He'll be be the all around cowboy again  
[ ac.guitar ]  
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow  
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin  
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeo he's the all around cowboy again  
He remembers the thrill...

Cross the desert like an Aram man

Just - get here if you can -  
You can reach me by sail boat  
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope  
Take a sled and slide down the-slope  
Into these arms of mine  
You can jump on a speedy colt  
Cross the border in a blaze of hope  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  
There are hills and mountains between us  
Always something to get over  
If I had my way, surely you would be closer  
I need you closer

Take me up on a carpet ride  
You can make it in a big balloon  
But you better make it soon'

If you can

30010,Don Henley,Gimme What You Got,"Baby picks off your plate--yours look's better  
And she throws hers on the floor  
Here, in the home of the brave  
And the land of the free  
The first word that baby learns is more  
  
So you're out there floating like a big, puffy cloud  
With the pool and the charcoal  
And the kids and the wife  
Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted  
And you step out into life  
  
And it's still gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
Now it's take and take takeover, takeover  
It's all take and never give  
All these trumped up towers  
They're just golden showers  
Where are people supposed to live?  
  
You can arm yourself, alarm yourself  
But there's nowhere you can run  
'Cause a man with a briefcase  
Can steal more money  
Than any man with a gun  
  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
Said gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
You got the price of admission--  
You don't have to ask permission  
To take somethin' from another man  
You cross a lawyer with the godfather, baby  
Make you an offer that you can't understand  
  
From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington  
From men to women to men  
It's a nation of noses pressed up against the glass  
They've seen it on the TV  
And they want it pretty fast  
  
You spend your whole life  
Just pilin' it up there  
You got stacks and stacks and stacks  
Then, Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder  
But you don't see no hearses with luggage racks  
  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got

Long before this heart of mine had broken down You were the one  
But now you're a lonely memory My heartache will never end  
Though all of those nights are far away I wish I were with you again.
Portofino I still remember the sun in your hair  
Portofino mariachi music that danced in the air  
Portofino I want you back in my arms  
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm holding you in the dark  
In Portofino where you broke my heart.  
I think of your face and still it can take my breath away After so long  
And though I'll be lonely living for only yesterday I'll get along  
Though now you're a faded memory My heartache will never end  
This unforgotten melody keeps playing over and over again  
Portofino I still remember the sun in your hair

Facing up to their responsibilities

But in the end true love can't be no fairytale  
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong  
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along

34109,Glen Campbell,Cold December In Your Heart,"A touch of April in your smile July and Agust in your yellow hair  
A sweet September in your eyes November notions in the clothes you wear  
You're every season's work of art but there's a cold December in your heart  
It seemed to me the day we met that all the flowers had begun to bloom  
I thought you'd help me to forget the dusty shadows of my lonely room  
I should have known right from the start about the cold December in your heart  
  
I loved you more and more each day through every season of the year  
Your lovin' laughter seemed to say your life was empty when I wasn't near  
Old love would lead you to the grave I was a fool to think you loved my too  
You always took but you never gave until you've taken all my love for you  
I feel a chill I must depart and leave the cold December in your heart  
In your heart in your heart

Words by Ray Boltz and Brent Alan Henderson, Music by Ray Boltz, Brent Alan
Henderson, and Steve Millikan  
I have walked in a garden  
The morning after the rain  
I have watched in silent wonder  
As everything changed  
Oh, what a gift from the Father  
Is the Water of Life  
Like a river that flows  
Deep in my soul  
Its from an endless supply  
Chorus I:  
Where do I go  
When I'm thirsty and dry?  
I go to the river  
And I always find  
Rest for my soul  
Peace for my mind  
I go to the river  
When Jesus prayed in the garden  
His brow was furrowed with pain  
And what appeared to be drops of blood  
Were falling down like the rain  
He found strength for the journey  
He found it down on His knees  
And where He knelt a river flows  
And it flows for you and me  
Chorus I  
Chorus ii:  
What do I do  
When I'm covered with stains  
I go to the river and I wash them away  
Everythings new  
Everythings changed  
I go to the river  
Its a river of healing  
Its a river of faith  
Its a river of gladness  
Its a river of grace  
Its a river of mercy  
Its a river of love  
Its a river of freedom  
Its a river of blood

Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it ain't over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in

Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin' down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent us an angel to help us out  
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't ever over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
Life is worth living again  
  
What I'd give for my affection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I ain't perfect, won't deny  
My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again

41770,Linkin Park,Mark The Graves,"There's a fragile game you play  
If the ghosts of yesterday  
If we can't let go whenever, say goodbye  
No trace of what remains  
No stones to mark the graves  
Only memories we thought we could deny  
  
There's so much more to lose  
Than the pain I put you through  
And my carelessness that left you in the dark  
And the blood may wash away  
But the skies will never fade  
At least I know somehow I made a mark  
  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right

42664,Mariah Carey,I Don't Wanna Cry,"Once again we sit in silence  
After all is said and done  
Only emptiness inside us  
Baby look what we've become  
We can make a million promises  
But we still won't change  
It isn't right to stay together  
When we only bring each other pain  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to cry  
Don't want to cry  
Nothing in the world  
Could take us back  
To where we used to be  
Though I've given you my heart and soul  
I must find a way of letting go  
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry  
  
Too far apart to bridge the distance  
But something keeps us hanging on and on  
Pretending not to know the difference  
Denying what we had is gone  
Every moment we're together  
Is just breaking me down  
I know we swore it was forever  
But it hurts too much to stay around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the magic's gone  
There's just a shadow of a memory  
Something just went wrong  
We can't go on make-believing

9186,Jason Mraz,After An Afternoon,"I bare my windowed self untamed and untrained  
Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults  
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall  
Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart  
Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.  
  
But there is something in the way you laugh  
That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me.  
  
After an afternoon with you  
And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling  
After an afternoon.  
  
Face to palm  
Tear to tear  
Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground  
I am in love.

17661,Rihanna,Million Miles Away,"Here we lay face to face once again  
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend  
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know  
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight  
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right  
And we both know that the story's ending  
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears  
Cause even though you're here  
It feels like you're a million miles away  
  
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?  
For what we were is like a season love is change  
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside  
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before  
While our song is playing its last note  
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

Soon the sky will open up and disarm me  
You will go just like you've gone before  
One sad soldier off to war, enemies that only you can see.  
  
Dishes stacked, the table cleared  
It's always like the scene of the last supper here  
You speak so cryptically that's not news to me  
The flood is here it will carry you  
And I've got work to do.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There is fire there is lust  
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust  
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails  
It's so simple the betrayal  
Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.  
  
Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Don't you recognize them anymore  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There's the given and the expected  
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected  
Is this for better is this for worse  
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.  
  
I hear the owl in the night  
I realize that some things never are made right  
By some will we string together here  
Days to months and months to years  
What if everything we have adds up to nothing.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door

That high makes things harder  
That high I get from you  
  
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms  
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart  
I think it's time to run 'cos I'm seeing stars  
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart  
  
I think of dying all the time  
But I've got joy to take my side  
Fear is my favorite ride

Trying to make love to a shopping arcade  
In northern England...  
Outside it was raining and I was feeling insecure  
Sooner or later you got to face the fact  
This world is shattered and it's too full of cracks to fill in  
So we just give in on a Thursday afternoon...  
In this little town where the traffic moves slow in the pouring rain  
I want to take you there where the four winds blow  
To be born again  
I was out there with the Beatles and the Cranks  
Trying to make some money and not to fall into the ranks of suburbia  
With Richard Toomey a visionary ghost...  
Sooner or later we make the same mistakes  
Our pockets are all empty and our spirit starts to break  
Just uke a baby left in the car park on a foggy new years eve...  
In this little town where winter begins  
In the summertime (summertime)  
I want to take you there  
Wash away our sins  
And be born again  
I was talking to some friends of mine trying to make some sense  
After drinking a case of wine from Yugoslavia but just before  
Breakfast we all started to agree... (wich was very unusual for us)  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In the pouring rain

To be born again

30055,Don McLean,Homeless Brother,"I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,  
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.  
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,  
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,  
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,  
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.  
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,  
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.  
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,  
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.  
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,  
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,  
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.  
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,  
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,  
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,  
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't  
Pretend,  
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brothe

For full restoration five dollars an hour  
And with each consultation a free holy flower  
And if she likes you, well you can have two  
  
And I came from nowhere like you and your friend  
My searching and wandering went on without end  
My future was dim, my spirit was crushed  
In one sacred moment my questions were hushed

A humble recruit of the taffeta booth  
Where all things are known but few are revealed  
Where sins are forgotten and sickness is healed  
For five dollars the flower is free

I'd sooner sleep on the floor  
  
Oh when will we learn really what loving is  
It's not what you get in return but what you give  
To think they once tore down the wall for a door  
But now they don't speak anymore

8480,Indigo Girls,Pushing The Needle Too Far,"Well I woke up this morning  
Grey dawn  
With a prayer on my breath  
See I lost something precious  
And God'll save me  
From losing myself  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
I think I know what's wrong  
  
Now I met the queen and I understand why  
Why she closed the door  
I'm not making excuses  
But you know I've been there a few times  
You know I was  
I was knocking on the door  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
I think I know what's wrong  
Wrong wrong  
  
There's a man  
He lived in a house  
Had a family of five  
Well he blew up the windows and the doors  
He said ""I just couldn't  
I just couldn't survive""  
We've all been removed  
In one way or another  
We don't know our families  
We don't need our brothers  
We're pushing the needle too far  
Pushing the needle too far  
  
Well if you wake up in the morning  
Grey dawn  
There's a prayer on your breath  
See maybe you lost something precious  
God'll save you  
From losing yourself  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
Let me hear you  
I think I know what's wrong  
  
There's queen who closed the door  
The family that lies  
People who turn  
The cat that has died  
A boy that odds  
A girl with a gun  
The world on its knees  
And a band on the run  
You know you'd help me more  
(The queen who closed the door)  
By not giving in  
(The family that lies)  
You know you'd help me more  
(People who turn)  
By not giving in  
(And the cat that has died)  
You know you'd help me more  
(A boy that odds)  
By not giving in  
(And a girl with a gun)  
I said you'd help me more  
(The world on it's knees)  
Now don't you give in  
(And a band on the run)  
Ah now you'd help me more  
By not giving  
I said don't you dare  
(Not giving in no)  
Don't you dare  
(Not giving in no)  
Don't you dare  
You'd help me more  
By not giving in  
I said you'd help me more  
By not giving in

Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?  
  
Juliet says hey it's Romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack  
He's underneath the window she's singing hey now my boyfriend's back  
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it?  
  
Juliet the dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded in my heart  
And I forget I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?  
  
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame  
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
  
Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin, yeah  
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  
  
I can't do the talk like they talk on TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be  
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
All I do is keep the beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song

Hey baby, where do you, comin' from  
Boy she looked at me and smiled,  
And looked into space

And see all your people on by one

41219,Lana Del Rey,Riverside,"I seen you walk along the riverside  
I seen you walk along at ease  
And in the air I feel a silence  
It whispers perfect on the breeze  
And there's a voice that keeps me company  
It takes me closer to the stream  
And in the break of any suffering  
It makes me feel like there's no pain  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe  
I'm up a creek and you're my paddle  
Where there is you there is my soul  
Another dream where I'm the witness  
I am the witness to your goal  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe.

48291,Phineas And Ferb,Thank You Santa,"Christmas morning, so much fun.  
Down the stairs the children run.  
Someone has eaten the cookies.  
And look what's left under the tree.  
There's presents for you and for me  
As far as the eye can see.  
What's on the rooftop  
I wonder what there was  
There's reindeer flyin' around the world  
Because Santa's comin'!  
I think we all should pause  
To say that we're grateful  
For everything he does.  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Woah...

And as the vision fades  
I'll say I was blinded by your eyes  
I felt them burn

24295,Arlo Guthrie,Moon Song,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Beneath this balcony of stars  
Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become  
The stuff of time amid the waves  
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done  
  
As the seabird flies aboce  
My songs are sung to those I've come to love  
The petals strung into the leis  
The flowering of days I've just begun  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
When gods and goddesses decreed  
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas  
The sound of sovereign thrones  
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans  
  
This crazy love amazes me  
As I just gaze into your eyes  
The liquid sun is split upon the sea  
I want to be where I can see the moon arise  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Before the moment fades to summarize  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
Along the lonely stretch of sand  
Reduced to just a woman and a man  
Bathed in the lunar light  
The likes of which I might just understand  
  
Among the myths I know are real  
The goddess disguised as herself revealed  
I sang her song out loud  
She sat herself beside me in the crowd  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Into the moment that she would allow  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

Eat too much chocolate

Never stop laughing

23251,Alabama,This Loves On Me,"Sittin' alone at a table for two, when she walked in  
I was down on my second love,  
Swore I'd never do that again  
She sat down beside me and tried to explain  
That two bad loves don't spoil the whole darn game  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that you're free  
This love's on me  
  
I thought my life was at the end of its rope  
Without true love, there could be no hope  
Then she asked if I would stay for the night  
She said, everything's gonna be all right  
The sun came up the very next day  
I knew what she meant when I heard her say  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that you're free  
This love's on me

39686,Kelly Clarkson,I Hate Myself For Losing You,"I woke up today  
Woke up wide awake  
In an empty bed  
Staring at an empty room  
I have myself to blame  
For the state I'm in today  
And now dying  
Doesn't seem so cruel  
And oh, I don't know what to say  
And I don't know anyway  
Anymore  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
I'm seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?  
  
You got what you deserved  
Hope you're happy now  
'Cause everytime I think of her with you  
It's killing me  
Inside, and  
Now I dread each day  
Knowing that I can't be saved  
From the loneliness  
Of living without you  
And, oh  
I don't know what to do  
Not sure that I'll pull through  
I wish you knew  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
I'm seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?

I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?  
What do you say when everything's said?  
Is the reason why he left you in the end?  
How do you cry when every tear you shed  
Won't ever bring him back again?  
I hate myself for loving you

22629,Zornik,We Are Lost,"I want to climb up in the sky with you  
To seize the stars and put them on your head  
I want to take you down  
Where the sun begins  
A journey on the clouds once again  
I wonder if I will ever see your face again  
And the rest of my opinion is of no importance  
Guess I have made a choice  
For us  
We are lost  
In this world  
We are lost  
In this time  
We are lost  
We decide  
We are lost  
We are lost, lost in our own world

Blink and you miss a beat  
  
Keep one of your eyes open at all times  
Think that you're on the brink?  
The shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan  
Consequence you'll see will be stranger than a gang of drunken mimes  
Situation has a stink  
Better clear the air before your son becomes a man  
  
Blink  
  
Everything's been augmented  
You've been left so far behind  
Think, for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your  
head  
Consequence you've seen has been stranger than sci-fi of any kind  
Situation baffles me  
I guess it's true you are too one of the walking dead  
  
You better think fast!  
?Cause you never know what's comin' around the bend  
You better not blink!  
For consequence is a bigger word than you think  
It's bigger than you and me

Producers: Brian Rawlings and Mark Taylor  
Album: Twenty Four Seven (99)  
  
Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that I'm stronger without you  
And that I'll never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Yeah I can live without you  
Live without you

13973,Nick Cave,John Finn's Wife,"Well the night was deep and the night was dark  
And I was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town  
Some big ceremony was going down  
Dancers writhed and squirmed and then,  
Came apart and then writhed again  
Like squirming flies on a pin  
In the heat and in the din  
Yes, in the heat and in the din  
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad john finn  
  
Well, midnite came and clock did strike  
And in she came, did john finn's wife  
With legs like scissors and butcher's knives  
A tattooed breast and flaming eyes  
And a crimson carnation in her teeth  
Carving her way through the dance floor  
And I'm standing over by the bandstand  
Every eye gaping on john finn's wife  
Yeah, every eye gaping on john finn's wife  
  
Now john finn's wife was something of a mystery  
In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty  
I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife  
Over near the bandstand with john finn's wife  
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair  
Sprinkled with wedding confettis  
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares  
Armed, as they were, with machetes  
And the night through the window was full of lights  
Winking and awatching at john finns' wife  
Winking and awatching at john finns' wife  
  
Next came the cops, all out on the town  
But it don't look like no trouble there  
As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits  
And I slip my hand between the thighs of john finn's wife  
And they seemed to yawn awake, her things  
It was a warm and very ferocious night  
The moon full of blood and light  
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight  
As I plotted in the ear of john finns' wife  
  
Enter john finn in his shrunken suit  
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot  
With his filled-down teeth and a hobnail boot  
And his fists full of pistols in his pockets  
Aiming at me and aiming at his wife  
The band fall silent fearing for their lives  
And with fear in my guts like tangled twine  
Cause all I got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife  
And mad john finns' wife is all  
And the three of us walk out of the hall  
  
Now the night bore down upon us all  
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call  
And guns did flare and guns did bawl  
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck  
Of mad john finn. I took his wretched life  
Now I'm over near the bandstand  
Every hand moving on john finns' wife  
Every hand moving on john finns' wife  
  
And john finns' wife  
Took all the flowers down  
From her hair  
And threw them on the ground  
And the flies did hum  
And the flies did buzz around  
Poor john finn  
Lying dead upon the ground  
Lying dead upon the ground

19532,Tool,Undertow,"Gone under two times.  
I've been struck dumb by a voice that  
Speaks from deep  
Beneath the cold black water.  
It's twice as clear as heaven,  
And twice as loud as reason.  
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed  
And just as undisturbing.  
The currents mouth below me opens up around me.  
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.  
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away.  
But I'm so comfortable, too comfortable.  
Shut up shut up shut up shut up  
Shut up shut up shut up shut up  
You're saturating me  
So how could I let this bring me  
Back to my knees again again again  
Under for the third time.  
I've been baptized by your voice.  
It screams from deep beneath the endless water.  
And it's half as high as heaven  
And half as clear as reason.  
It's cold and black like silt on the riverbed.  
But I'm so comfortable.  
Far too comfortable.  
Why don't you kill me,  
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,  
And I'm back on my knees.  
Lost in euphoria.  
I'm back down. I'm in the undertow.  
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow.  
I'll die within your undertow.  
It seems there's no other way out of this undertow.  
Euphoria.

28660,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,"Met my old lover in the grocery store  
The snow was falling Christmas Eve  
I stood behind her in the frozen foods  
And I touched her on the sleeve  
  
She didn't recognize the face at first  
But then her eyes flew open wide  
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse  
And we laughed until we cried  
  
We took her groceries to the check out stand  
The food was totaled up and bagged  
We stood there lost in our embarrassment  
As the conversation lagged  
  
We went to have ourselves a drink or two  
But couldn't find an open bar  
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store  
And we drank it in her car  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how  
  
She said she's married her an architect  
Who kept her warm and safe and dry  
She would have liked to say she loved the man  
But she didn't like to lie  
  
I said the years had been a friend to her  
And that her eyes were still as blue  
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw  
Doubt or gratitude  
  
She said she saw me in the record stores  
And that I must be doing well  
I said the audience was heavenly  
But the traveling was Hell  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to time  
Reliving, in our eloquence  
Another ""Auld Lang Syne""  
  
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired  
And running out of things to say  
She gave a kiss to me as I got out  
And I watched her drive away  
  
Just for a moment I was back at school  
And felt that old familiar pain  
And, as I turned to make my way back home  
The snow turned into rain

When a rose is in love with you  
Slaves of our hearts, that's what we are  
We loved and died where roses grew  
  
They watched us silently  
  
A rose is free, a rose is wild  
And who would know better than I do?  
Roses are not made for love

You are my lust

Watch me work, hey, hey, stand back now  
Look out, mama, it's dog eat dog  
Nose against the grindstone, it feels real good

And the presents are hiding somewhere  
And the world is so peaceful and still  
You can almost hear love in the air  
  
There's a blanket of snow on the ground  
And a bright little star in the sky  
And your heart knows that Santa is near  
By the twinkle in everyone's eye  
  
There's gift bringing and bells ringing  
And warm little feet by the fire  
There are kids playing and folks praying  
And somewhere the sound of a choir  
  
There's two people that never will part  
And two stockings we still have to fill  
There's a warm little place in my heart  
For our warm little home on the hill

The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe
as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him.  
  
With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue
and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to
find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

And his faithful heart  
Would not consider any other wife

Of the last two island swans.  
  
There love was like a circle  
With no beginning and no end  
With his lady by his side  
A treasure and best friend  
  
And the pond was oh so peaceful  
And the rising of the sun  
Young and free as the island breeze  
Their lives had just begun  
  
Till a dark day in November  
With the seering cold that starts  
Stalked the hunter with his bow  
And put an arrow through her heart

And the cold wind blow  
He was brave but he lay low  
By her body in the isle of mist  
I saw her give him one last cold kiss  
One last cold kiss  
  
Now swans like people  
Talk of only one in this fair side  
Though they brought him 20 ladies  
He would take no other bride  
  
And they say he will not move  
From the place where she did fall  
Once so proud he's beaten now  
And he will not rise at all

You may think it's a leaf!  
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth

Much mota, many different kinds in the bag  
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love  
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs  
If it's weed, then I'm with it

53144,Tim Buckley,I Had A Talk With My Woman,"had a talk with my woman late last night  
And she reassured me everything was alright  
And time hung still like a falling rain  
Now i know at last that my love is safe  
Ah but when i go away my love i leave  
Lord i'm but half a man without her by my side  
She's this memory that i hold all around  
She's this dream that i always hold to believe  
  
I wanna go upon a mountain  
And sing my love and sing my love  
I wanna sing it high, sing it down low  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
  
Well you know your moses, oh lord he lost his way  
Ah, and your jesus don't remember the words  
Well then i guess it's just you and me brother  
All alone in this cold world  
All alone in this cold world  
  
Ah, you gotta go upon a mountain  
And learn to sing your love, learn to sing your love  
You know i can sing it high, sing it down low  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last

Wash down the city skies

Make it like it was long before i was born

52747,Taylor Swift,Dear John,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps,  
Praying the floor won't fall through, again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind,  
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game,  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ""run as fast as you
can""  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home  
  
Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong  
Don't you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?  
I should've known  
  
You are an expert at sorry,  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry  
Have tired, lifeless eyes  
'Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,  
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.  
  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You should've known, you should've known  
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known

Locked in a giant house, that's alarming

And it's fitting, he's barely living a day he'll soon forget

He's lying dead, clutching Benjamins, never put the money down  
He's stiffening, we're all whistling, a man we'll soon forget

Once again she's leaving, but Lord, she's not to blame  
This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break  
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay  
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I won't be left lonely,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything

And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else  
So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair  
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
  
Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own  
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone  
Then I cried ""Lord there must be a surer and easier way  
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday""  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try

14138,Nina Simone,Either Way I Lose,"If I stay, I know I'm that I'ma share your love and that I couldn't take.  
And if I go, we'll be apart and I know my heart would surely break.  
So, what difference does it make, which one I choose?  
Either way I lose.  
  
Though I know, my love is true.  
I'd die if you ever told me good-bye.  
Ever told me good-bye.  
And I know, she loves you too.  
She would do, the same as I.  
  
What difference does it make, which one I choose?  
Either way I lose.

Either way I lose.

30929,Electric Light Orchestra,The Way Life's Meant To Be,"Well, I came a long way to be here today  
And I left you so long on this avenue  
And here I stand in the strangest land  
Not knowing what to say or do  
As I gaze around at these strangers in town  
I guess the only stranger is me  
And I wonder, yes I wonder  
Is this the way life's meant to be  
  
Although it's only a day since I was taken away  
And left standing here looking in wonder  
The ground at my feet, maybe it's just the old street  
But everything that I know lies under  
And when I see what they've done to this place that  
was home  
Shame is all that I feel  
And I wonder, yes I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be  
  
Too late, too late to cry  
The people say  
Too late for you, too late for me  
You've come so far, now you know everything  
My friend  
Just look and see the wonders of our world  
  
As I wander around this wreck of a town  
Where people never speak aloud  
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers  
I wish I was back in 1981  
Just to see your face instead of this place  
Now I know what you mean to me  
And I wonder, yes, I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be.

33183,Garth Brooks,Alabama Clay,"First time he saw the ground get busted  
He was ten and it was 1952  
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown  
And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules  
  
The farm grew to be a moneymaker  
And the house he lived in grew up room by room  
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin'  
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon  
  
His neck was red as Alabama clay  
But the city's call pulled him away  
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine  
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green  
  
Now the city's just a prison without fences  
His job is just a routine he can't stand  
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces  
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands  
  
Then one day a picture came inside a letter  
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms  
And the words she wrote would change his life forever  
So he went to raise his family on the farm  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay

18285,Roxy Music,Serenade,"Darkness falls  
Around your window pane  
A light still burns  
But just a smouldering flame  
Is it the end of another affair  
An open engagement with gloom  
Or will you be smiling  
When the sun conjures up  
A broken spell au clair de lune?  
  
Silhouette  
As you draw the shade  
Cloak of night  
You know it's tailor-made  
G-Plan gymnastics  
By an everglow fire  
Could never mean the same  
As summer enchantment  
By an old mill steam  
From courtly love to costly game  
Maybe I'm wrong for seeming  
Ungrateful, unforgiving  
Oh how it hurts now you're finally leaving  
I couldn't take anymore  
  
Now's the time!  
Let's hide away  
Sacred hours  
Saved from yesterday  
Boo-hoo willows weep around you still  
Mirror reflections of dew  
But waterfall pages of an open book  
Could shower new horizons soon  
Call the tune  
Will you swoon  
As I croon  
Your serenade

Use up air that others could breathe

At the cost of others you get by

For an easy way out of life  
  
A pathetic excuse for a human being  
  
Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought  
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not

What you and I spoke of  
What you and I spoke of

Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards  
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so live  
Now you and I, you and I  
Not so little you and I anymore  
And with this silence brings a moral story  
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

Well I'm already finally out of

And if I never ever hear it ring  
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside  
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay

And a tooth for a tooth  
Ain't it the truth?  
  
If you got nine lives, you might survive  
'Cause nothing's free on the other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wheelin', dealin', cheatin', stealin'  
Just to stay alive  
They got love for sale, yes, for sale  
On the New York subway line  
Watch the working girls hanging out  
Turning tricks underneath the lights  
The lights  
  
One step from Hell  
The poor men sell their soul  
For a taste of wine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it's said and done  
And you're on the run  
And the only law comes under the gun

9035,James Taylor,Believe It Or Not,"Believe it or not, I've been waiting for you to come through, love of my life.  
Believe it or not, I've been waiting for you to come through, love of my life.  
And though the hour grew later and later, I would hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, ""today, today, today, today.""  
  
As strange as it seems, I remember your face from before, believe it or not.  
Before you and I were washed up on this alien shore, as strange as that seems  
Though the hour grew later and later, still I'd hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, ""today, today, today, today.""  
  
Today the world seems brighter. Light and bright and right somehow.  
I could not have held on tighter, waiting for the past to come to pass, no.  
  
Once in a dream I've seen myself through your eyes, this you should know.  
Wading the stream that flows in between you and I, once in a dream.  
And though the hour grew later and later, I would hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, ""today, today, today, today.""

28808,David Allan Coe,Crazy Mary,"Crazy Mary from Londonderry  
Lives next door to the cemetery  
How many lovers have you buried  
We would shout running scared  
Along the green and golden paths  
That took us home away from Crazy Mary  
  
In the lamplight burning low  
Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...  
  
So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...

I stand and stare in wonder  
There's bright light and there's thunder  
In pachinko land  
  
Well versed in the way of zen  
My pockets lined full of yen  
I walk the aisle and back again  
And sit at domo's hand

Staring in a trance  
  
Turn the handle to the right  
A stream of silver balls in flight  
It screams and howls a blaze of light  
The earth moves below me  
I'm laughing tears of sheer delight

Nothing that you've done remains  
Only what you do for Me

But you just hold on to what I have told you

You stay a little while and then you're gone again.  
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.  
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own,  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

You'll wake up some cold day and find you're all alone.  
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye.""  
When I tun around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry.  
  
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.  
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.  
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?  
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

Of first and main  
Of any city  
Of a hundred names  
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low  
  
And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow  
And the cats are out, gonna harmonize  
They're headed for cool street on the main line  
And here comes that joe serpentine  
The life of a cat can leave you far behind  
  
They're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
It's hard to be yourself  
When everyone else is around  
There's always someone out there  
Trying to pull you down  
  
You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon  
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon  
You bet your life and you sell your soul  
Give it all up for beggar's gold  
And the hidden city has its own laws  
Produces a species cats without claws  
  
They're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
Oh, here they come again  
Singing songs in a melody  
Do, do, do, do, do  
  
Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life  
And the streets are full of pain  
Specially when it's calling out your name  
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice  
The things the world has to offer nice  
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive  
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind  
  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause

All my exes live in texas like I'm george strait  
Or they go to georgia state where-  
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta  
That she only see when she feels obligated  
Admitted it to me the first time we dated  
But she was no angel, and we never waited  
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck  
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it  
And we never talk too much after I blew up  
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'  
And I think I text her and told her I made it  
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it  
And that's when I text her and told her I love it  
And right after texting, told her I'm faded  
She asked  
What have I learned since getting richer  
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures  
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture  
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya  
Damn, is it the fall  
Time for me to revisit the past  
It's women to call  
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved  
There's stories to tell, we been through it all  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions

So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air, so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew  
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you  
I flew jet, she flew commercial  
But we still met, later that night  
After my session, she came over  
I was aggressive, and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did, but that was last month  
And now she's texting me, asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon' catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit, sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasn't married  
Promises, I hope I never break 'em  
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
[Bridge:]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?

Can't even find you.

Did you make him understand  
That he can't touch you.  
  
Wysteria, did he take you to the fair?  
Were the folks that you met there  
The same that we met?  
Wysteria, did he teach you how to dance  
Did he bring you paper fans to hide your secret?  
Was he just like all the rest  
When he got to the sad part  
Did he stay a bit too long  
To save his heart.

Do they still bloom just  
At night and die at sunrise?

God only knows what he saw  
Hitch up your ass and your camel  
Fill up your skin at the well  
Roll up your tent, whisper your prayers  
Are you ready to ride through hell  
Caravan moving through the night  
sleeping in the light of day  
Caravan spinning through the void  
on our way to anywhere  
Caravan time is just a joke change is all we  
understand  
Caravan life is a mirage,  
only a mirage dancing on the desert sand  
How I recall all the mountains  
How I remember the farm  
Oh how I miss the big city  
With a pretty girl on my arm  
Sell my best friend for some water  
Cut off my leg for some shade  
Sunburn these thoughts from my memory  
If I live I will be remade  
The sand is like a razor  
Slashing at my face  
Everyone's in panic but you can't see any place  
It's a sand storm, taken by surprise  
Hide beneath your wrappings and cover up your eyes  
Well I lost my kit and camel  
Maybe I will die  
Feel so lost and helpless and I think I'm gonna cry  
It's a sand storm, nothing you can do  
No one knows if it will last  
No one knows if you will make it through  
It's been so long without water  
Vultures are filling the air  
Where is that bloody oasis  
Must be around here somewhere  
Time for some strong meditation  
Time for the ultimate change  
Time to make peace with your maker  
Everything has been prearranged

And really not to blame  
  
You're riding a tiger

Waged upon the wall  
And likewise all the missiles  
Shot to make them fall

Here in the shelter  
Whole unafraid

Who formed our leader he is the one  
Who will offer the silence

So fine I just can't get away  
Now I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind  
  
Harmless and innocent you devil in white  
You stole my will without a fight  
You filled me with confidence, but you blinded my eyes  
You tricked me with visions of Paradise  
Now I realize I'm  
  
Snowblind, can't live without you  
So fine I just can't get away  
Now I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind

50208,Rascal Flatts,Words I Couldn't Say,"In a book in a box in the closet  
In a line in a song I once heard  
In a moment on a front porch late one June  
In a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon  
  
There it was at the tip of my fingers  
There it was on the tip of my tongue  
There you were, and I had never been that far  
There it was: the whole world wrapped inside my arms  
And I let it all slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
What do I do now that you're gone?  
No back up plan, no second chance  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldn't say  
  
There's a rain that'll never stop falling  
There's a wall that I've tried to take down  
What I should've said just wouldn't pass my lips  
So I held back, and now we've come to this  
And it's too late now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are the words I couldn't say  
  
I should have found a way to tell you how I felt  
Now the only one I'm tellin' is myself

What do I do, what do I say?  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldn't say

God will take good care of you

I've found true happiness  
Cause I'm getting richer, day by day

Just call my toll free number  
You can do it anyway you want  
Just do it right away

You'll believe everything I'm saying  
If wanna get closer to him

sometimes it seems that darkness always falls

you're sinking slowly into the deep

where you would walk through sparkling spheres,  
on strangest drugs and without fears  
you feel just like a little girl  
and all your dreams lie frozen on the moon  
you left them ther some time ago  
but it ain't true that you don't need them anymore  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
don't give up, kill the pain, don't start crying again  
here it comes, here it comes, the golden handshake of life  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
keep the faith, stop to fight  
and walk out into the night  
you're so strong, yes you are  
reach out for your star....

they're dying some day  
sometimes it seems that silence crawls all over  
sometimes it's hell inside and hell out there  
your heart is nothing but a haunted place  
is that you in the mirror?  
You're all alone inside a world  
full of confusion and of strange alarms  
and though your courage left you long ago  
it doesn't mean that you don't have it anymore

And it shines through each year  
And it makes things seem different somehow

It's for people who thirst  
For a love that burns brighter right now  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
There were things that were said  
There were things that were done  
And a wife cannot stand too much pain  
And what I thought was best  
Couldn't please her much less  
But my love still goes on, that don't change  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone

I gotta set it off, Jada Queen and Vivica  
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her  
Got no problem with you, niggas, get it how you live it, bro  
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver you  
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you  
If not my boy will put the beats on you, Karen Civil you  
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia  
My advice, don't mess with his man, word to Nivea  
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia  
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there  
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware  
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there  
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it  
It's hard to get off the ground, y'all think I just levitated  
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated  
Y'all think 'cause I never stated I never been devastated  
All y'all see is sun shining, think I was never shaded  
Y'all think these calendar models is all that I ever dated  
Nigga, nothing was the same, HOT 97 played it  
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it  
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated  
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated  
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady  
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded  
And while I chill, loaded up a steel  
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will  
  
Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't, don't  
They don't have a hand on your head of what you're doing now  
You're damned if you do them, if you don't  
People sit around and judge you anyway  
Don't, don't, don't

8092,Ian Hunter,The Outsider,"Death be my mistress, guns be my wife  
Breath is my witness and roads are my life  
Just give my future's clean as a knife  
Far on the way from L.A.  
  
The sun heats the saddle, sand in my hair  
Looking for water and there's sweat everywhere  
Know that I'm nearer I smell damp air  
I ain't tasted coffee for days  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunters hunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider  
  
Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall  
Damned if I can't remember it all  
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall  
I paid for the funeral crew  
And it seems like I never reach Mexico  
They're heading me off every place that I go  
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low  
What else can an outsider do  
  
I know they're near to me, I don't have to see  
Just let me be the outsider  
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind  
They won't find the outsider  
The outsider  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunter's haunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider  
The outsider. The outsider.

With the kids jingle-belling  
And everyone telling you be of good cheer  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friend come to call  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost story  
And tales of glories of christmas long, long ago  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing

I though I heard somebody cry)  
I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isn't true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul . . . Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat . . . Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet . . . Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When I'm asleep  
I don't believe . . .I don't believe  
The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me

2963,Christmas Songs,Christmas Dinner,"(Paul Stookey, 1963)  
  
And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
Outside standing, lonely boy-child  
Cold and shivering in the night  
  
On the street, every window  
Save but one, was gleaming bright  
And to this window walked the boy-child  
Peeking in saw, candle light  
  
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys  
Ducks and geese, cherry pies  
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady  
Table bare and tears in her eyes  
  
Into his coat reached the boy-child  
Knowing well there was little there  
He took from his pocket,  
His own Christmas dinner  
A bit of cheese, some bread to share  
  
His outstretched hands  
Held the food and they trembled  
As the door, it opened wide  
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner  
Gently said she, Come inside  
  
The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table  
Glasses two and her last drop of wine  
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas  
And especially, yours and mine  
  
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
That in that town, the happiest Christmas  
Was shared by candle light

Or I'll tie him up with duck tape  
  
I want a new duck  
A mallard I think  
One that won't make a mess of my house  
Or build a nest in the bathroom sink  
  
I want a new duck  
One that won't steal my beer  
One that won't stick his bill in my mail  
One that knows the duck stops here  
  
One that won't drive me crazy waddling all around  
One who'll teach me how to swim and help me not to drown  
And show me how to get down  
How to get down baby  
  
Get it?  
  
I want a new duck  
Not a swan or a goose  
Just a drake I can dress real cute  
Think I'm gonna name him Bruce  
  
I want a new duck  
Not a quail or an owl  
One that won't molt to much  
One that won't smell too fowl  
  
One that won't beg for breadcrumbs  
Hangin' around all day  
He'd better mind his manners  
Better do just what I say  
Or he's gonna be duck patte, duck patte, yah, yah

1000,Backstreet Boys,Something That I Already Know,"Here we are, seven days  
And seven nights of empty tries  
It's ritual, habitual  
But it's never gonna work this time  
  
We're to the point of no return  
And along the way the only thing we've learned  
Is how to hurt each other  
  
I'm looking back and wondering why  
It took so long to realize  
That nothing's changed, it never will  
All these years of standing still  
And still we stay in all this pain  
And nothing's gonna make it go away  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
  
So save your voice  
Don't waste your breath  
Can't you see we're at the end  
And this goodbye is permanent  
So wish me well and try to forget  
  
And all the fights  
And all the ways  
We almost made it  
But we never did  
And it's finally come to this  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
  
We can not hide what we've become  
So sick and tired of being numb  
It's done, it's done  
It's done  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know

'Cause I know, 'cause I know

I can see the sadness that throws a shadow down on everything you do

You don't know what it's like to feel this kind of helplessness

You are going to find a reason to push me away  
You are going to find reasons to blame me for your pain

Is a secret voodoo stand

Then the dead will come for you, yeah  
You better hold your tongue now, Salem  
'Cause l don't believe in ghosts  
There is only one thing left to do now  
And that is sending of dead  
The four shadows are meeting again  
At the cemetery gates, darkness is a friend  
Midnight will soon be here  
Everything should be ready by now for sending of dead  
Place the image of Saint Expedit  
Upside down and around

Let the ritual begin  
Almighty God, father of mine, come for Sarah Lafayette  
That she may be disappeared forever lost  
Saint Expedit, you are a saint and I'm a sinner  
I send you to find Sarah Lafayette  
Oh, rid me of her head and rid me of her soul  
Rid me of all her thoughts, rid me of her memory  
For this curse to work, Baron Samedi, Samedi, Samedi  
Send your blessing, so Sarah may be gone  
As if he was sent from the sky  
Baron Samedi creeps inside  
The doctor's body, speaking to Salem  
You must bring me a sacrifice  
You must come back before midnight  
Kneel before my cross, Salem is there  
He takes a handful of soil from each grave  
Of the dead he wants to send into Sarah  
Now quick, quick run back to the house  
The soil must lie where Sarah sleeps

Knowing you're watching me from far away  
Somewhere that I've never been

It don't mean you have to be afraid of how  
We're not the same, don't leave me now  
  
But darling there you go, slipping away  
  
How can I get you to stay where you are  
Keep you from going too far  
Holding you here is so hard to do  
I'm losing you  
  
And darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace  
Drifting away into your sacred place

So that all the father's children could be free

They line up like it's some kind of ritual  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place  
  
I like the good things in life  
But most of the best things ain't free  
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife  
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy  
Young and you're crazy...  
  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

27454,Chicago,Policeman,"Everyday he wakes up  
As his bare feet hit the floor  
Grabs a cup of coffee  
Straps his Magnum on once more  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
Since his wife walked out the door  
In nine years he'll retire with a pension  
Everyday he suffers  
'Cause he sees all kinds of pain  
Sometimes feels helpless  
In a world that's gone insane  
Then he wins a battle  
It restores his faith again  
It's only human kindness he is after  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
Every night he comes home  
With a sixpack all alone  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
He picks up the telephone  
Needs to talk with someone  
But the only love he's known  
Was lost forever, he is a policeman  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show

45549,Nick Cave,Grief Came Riding,"A grief came riding  
On the wind  
Up the [Solemn] river Thames  
I was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open  
When I felt it entering  
  
I began thinkin' about our wedding day  
And how love was a vow  
I was thinkin' about the chamber door  
Only we can enter now  
  
I began thinkin' about our ancient friends  
And of kissin' them goodbye  
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge  
And a tear broke from my eye  
  
I started thinkin' about London  
[How] nothing good ever came from this town  
And if the Thames weren't so filthy  
I would jump in the river and drown  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
Thinking loud  
  
[A grief came riding on the wind  
Up the river where the bridges crouch  
Blowin' people back and forth  
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch]  
  
Blowin' people far apart  
Blowin' others so they collide  
Blowin' some poor bastard right out of the water  
Blowin' another one over the side  
  
Hear the ancient iron bridge  
And listen to it groan  
With the weight of a thousand people  
Leavin' or returning home  
  
To their failures  
To their bordoms  
To their husbands  
And their [wives]  
Who are carving them up for dinner  
Before they even arrive  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
[Thinking loud]  
  
Now look there just [Below] the water  
See the saviour of the human race,  
[with] the fishes and the frogs,  
Has found his final resting place  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down

Somewhere between the window and the phone you'll find me waiting here all
alone  
I've thought about leaving but I'd go right on grieving  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
If the phone should ring I wonder what I'd say  
Would I tell you that I love you in the same sweet way  
If you look through the window I'll be home  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window...

If you could see  
You'd reach out for me  
  
In hallways  
And in secret doorways  
Were love's hiding places  
With nowhere to go  
Goodbye  
To the fields and byways  
I remember saying  
I don't want to leave  
Cos you, were all, there was to know  
About me  
  
Somewhere  
On this crazy island  
A familiar stranger  
Sleeps so far away  
Wonder in the eyes of children  
And the smile of fortune  
Helps the memory fade  
Cos they are all there is to know  
About me  
  
Who are you now

And tell myself it's really over  
And put aside this misery

Packed my shit and left home like the prodigal son  
With a bottle of jack and my shotgun strapped,  
I went looking for fame and yo I've never been back  
  
Filled with spite staying high as a kite,  
I was dealin and stealin everything in sight  
Pool hustling trying to make that green,  
I've been ramblin and gamblin since the age of 13  
  
Working like a bitch like a god damn tank,  
Some disagree because my rents had bank  
But all that's gold non't always glitter,  
So I'll take another puff from my one hitter  
  
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,  
Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine  
'Cause money, money, money ain't shit to me,  
But I gotta make a lot just to be free  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm here and I'm there  
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere  
I'm here and I'm there  
I'm Kid Rock hoe and I'm everywhere  
  
Many nights she comes to me  
She feels me where I lay  
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way  
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go  
  
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show  
Please God, please I'll pay any cost,  
If you'd just stop the world cause I want to get off  
  
There's too much hardship there's too much pain  
There's too many motherfuckers tryin to get in my brain  
I've been to your mountains I've been to your seaside,  
And everywhere I went somebody's wanted a free ride  
  
But parasites can't fade the Rock,  
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot  
'Cause I hold key to my own success,  
And suckers that step willll be put to rest, yes,  
  
I hold the key to my own success,  
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest,  
So pass the buddha,  
The funky tie hooter,  
  
And watch me rip because I'm such a slick shooter.  
Not a generic dime a dozen m.c.,  
Never was in a posse never wanted to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Many nights she comes to me  
She feels me where I lay  
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way  
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go  
  
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show  
Now I've been walkin the earth since the beginning of time,  
And won't leave till I've received that 7th sign  
All this talk their gonna drop the bomb,  
  
But life keeps going on and on and on and on  
The world's end don't worry me,  
And I'm gonna get where I'm going just hurry me  
'Cause I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushin,  
  
Everything is slow motion like I'm trippin on tussin  
Fussin with the girls they waste my time,  
Thrashin and bashin going out of my mind  
Crucified by the critics everyday,  
  
'Cause I ain't really got that much to say  
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,  
I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time  
I live my life just like the skipper,  
  
But only at night because I'm a day tripper  
Twitchin-shakin,  
And I kick more bass then John Paul Jones  
Visions of red shoot through my head,  
And I won't stop trippin till the day I'm dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Many nights she comes to me  
She feels me where I lay  
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way  
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go  
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show

56936,XTC,Beating Of Hearts,"Do you know what noise awakes you  
Every morning from your bed  
A-coming from the farthest hillside  
A-coming from inside your head  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
[Chorus:]  
Louder than tanks on the highway  
Louder than bombers in flight  
Louder than noises of hatred  
Dancing us from darkest night is the rhythm of love  
Powered on the the beating of hearts  
  
And did you know you had this power?  
Drumming on it always stays  
Never try to use it badly  
Tunes of good are all it plays  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can visit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For a heart without love is a song with no words  
And a tune to which no-one is listening  
So your heart must give love and you'll find that  
You shine like rain on the leaves you'll be glistening  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
Louder than thoughts of dictators  
Louder than rattling swords  
Louder than loading of rifles  
Louder than screaming warlords

34261,Gordon Lightfoot,All I'm After,"All I'm after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess  
  
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day  
  
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What I'm seeing's worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad, in your special way  
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Ain't it funny how life changes every day

17496,Reo Speedwagon,Can't Fight This Feeling,"Oh I can't fight this feeling any longer  
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow  
What started out as friendship,  
Has grown stronger  
I only wish I had the strength to let it show  
  
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever  
I said there is no reason for my fear  
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together  
You give my life direction  
You make everything so clear  
  
And even as I wander  
I'm keeping you in sight  
You're a candle in the window  
On a cold, dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars, forever  
  
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crushing through your door  
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore  
  
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you  
I've been running round in circles in my mind  
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl  
'Cause you take me to the places  
That alone I'd never find  
  
And even as I wander  
I'm keeping you in sight  
You're a candle in the window  
On a cold, dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars, forever  
  
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

""You can't walk away now.""  
  
I looked back once  
And all I saw was his face  
Smiling, the needle crying  
Walking out of his room  
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream  
You'll never get away  
  
Cold and shaking  
I crawled down alleys to try  
And scrape away the tracks that marked me  
Slammed my face into walls of concrete  
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries  
Cries your name  
  
Wet and raving  
The needle keeps calling me back  
To bloody my hands forever  
Carved my cure with the blade  
That left me in scars  
Now every time I'm weak  
Words scream from my arm  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,

All I really got to do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

For someone in second place

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Maybe, yeah maybe

We'll meet again and you'll need me, you'll see me completely  
Every little bit  
Oh yeah maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then  
  
I don't want to be tough  
And I don't want to be proud  
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found  
I'm not lost  
I need to be loved  
I just need to be loved  
I just want to be loved by you and I won't stop 'cause I believe  
That maybe, yeah maybe  
Maybe, yeah maybe  
Maybe, maybe  
  
I should know better than to touch the fire twice  
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you might  
  
Maybe, love maybe

12899,Michael Bolton,Don't Make Me Wait On Love,"(duet with kenny G)  
Sittin' here, just starin' at your picture  
Waiting for your call  
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion  
We could have it all  
Time and time again, You tell me to be patient  
But we can't let love slip away  
  
Chorus:  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness  
Fall asleep alone  
Give me a sign, a man's not suppose to face life  
Standing on his own  
When you're near me, I can't help but see forever  
Come and rescue me tonight  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't you see I need ya, gotta have ya  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love this time  
No No I need you right now, I need you right now  
Oh darlin', a love like this, a love like this  
Is so very hard to find, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love

50081,Randy Travis,Come See About Me,"Somebody listen, I'm a voice in the distance cryin'  
Come see about me  
I am a stranger in a world filled with anger  
Come see about me  
I'm gettin' weary tryin' to carry this load all by myself  
I'm bone tired and fallin', can't you hear me callin'  
I need somebody's help  
  
I am a young man growin' wild across this land  
Come see about me  
I'm fourscore and twenty and I ain't got anybody  
Come see about me  
I'm somebody's children alone and forsaken, a wave  
That's lost at sea  
I'm right here behind you, I'm all around you,  
So slow down  
Turn around and you will see  
  
I'm your mother, your sister and your brother  
Come see about me  
I am a baby, my mother ain't no lady  
Come see about me  
I am your maker, the giver and the taker  
Come see about me

5438,Etta James,Do Right Woman Do Right Man,"Take me to heart  
And I'll always love you  
And nobody can make me do wrong  
Take me for granted  
Leaving love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong  
[Chorus:]  
A woman's only human  
You should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
They say it's a man's world  
But you can't prove that by me  
And as long as we're together  
Show some respect for me  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
[Chorus:]  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man

38835,Journey,What I Needed,"Missing something in my life  
Searching for it day and night  
Couldn't seem to get it right  
'Til you walked my way  
Leaving lovers one by one  
Didn't like who I'd become  
Couldn't face myself, I turn and run  
Made me see that I could change  
  
Out of my darkness  
As I step into the light  
We get a new day  
Taking one step at a time  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl, you were my rescue  
All I needed was you  
  
I used to always get my way  
Told me that you wouldn't stay  
Had to face it, what you had to say  
If I wanted you  
You tell me when I did you wrong  
I guess I've known it all along  
Cared enough and you stood strong  
I believed in you  
  
In my frustrations  
Tried to become someone else  
The years I've wasted  
I'd been lying to myself  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Hear me calling  
What I needed  
What I needed was you  
  
In you I found shelter  
How you believed in me, stood strong  
You were there through my darkest hour  
You lifted my spirit up  
Brought out the best in me  
And now I'll stand before you with all my love  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
But you made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl you were my rescue  
What I needed was you

52441,Styx,Carrie Ann,"Time stands still, baby when I touch you  
I can't believe the way I'm feelin'  
Please don't speak, it's taken me all this time  
To find the strength just to say  
  
That I never knew what love was til I met you  
Never thought that I could act this way  
But I'm still afraid to show how much I need you  
Tell me, what makes a man like me this way  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Lovers' hearts never quite beat in time  
They never find that perfect rhythm  
You know I let you down many times  
But this I promise to you  
That I'll never lead you through doors of deception  
I won't bind you to a chain of lies  
Though I know my love for you won't be perfection  
What I give to you will last all time  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Take a little time to realize  
I'll love you faithfully  
Just take a little time and you'll see  
That baby it's me  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart

Before my head explodes  
Or my head starts to ring

5883,Faith Hill,Come Home,"[Faith hill]  
Hello world  
Hope you're listening  
Forgive me if I'm young  
For speaking out of turn  
There's someone I've been missing  
I think that they could be  
The better half of me  
They're in the wrong place trying to make it right  
But I'm tired of justifying  
So I say to you...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known  
So come home...  
  
[Faith hill]  
I get lost in the beauty  
Of everything I see  
The world ain't as half as bad  
As they paint it to be  
When all the sons, all the daughters  
Stopped to take it in  
Then hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin  
It might start now  
But maybe I'm just dreaming out loud  
But until then  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known  
So come home...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Everything I can't be  
Is everything you should be  
And that's why I need you here  
  
Everything I can't be  
Is everything you should be  
And that's why I need you here  
So hear this now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known,  
Ever known  
  
Come home...  
Come home...

Whenever I fall down  
And I can't say enough
