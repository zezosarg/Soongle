49252,Quarterflash,Talk To Me,"There's some out there tonight  
Who's lost and lonely, too  
There's a heart beating just with mine  
There's a voice in the air  
But it just can't get through  
I'm hoping that someday I'll find someone  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
There's a song in the air,  
But I can't hear the words  
There's a promise that's never made  
There's a voice in the streets  
That no one's ever heard  
I'm hoping I'll hear it someday calling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
Somewhere there's a voice that's calling  
Someone who's alone and falling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart

30370,Doors,The Movie,"The movie will begin in five moments  
The mindless voice announced  
All those unseated will await the next show.  
  
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall  
The auditorium was vast and silent  
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued.  
  
The program for this evening is not new  
You've seen this entertainment through and through  
You've seen your birth your life and death  
you might recall all of the rest  
Did you have a good world when you died?  
Enough to base a movie on?.  
  
I'm getting out of here  
Where are you going?  
To the other side of morning  
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas  
  
Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand.  
  
It's alright, all your friends are here  
When can I meet them?  
After you've eaten  
I'm not hungry  
Uh, we meant beaten  
  
Silver stream, silvery scream  
  
Oooooh, impossible concentration.

52394,Stone Temple Pilots,Hello It's Late,"Hello, it's late  
You know I've tried to stop the rain  
Did you read about it?  
Did you think about it?  
Did you cry but nothing came?  
  
Hello it's late  
I know we tried to win the game  
Did you hear about it?  
Did you dream about it?  
I know you cried but nothing changed?  
Nothing matters again  
I didn't think it'd last that long  
But I'm just sittin' on this merry-go-round,  
And the music is too loud  
  
It's just a game  
That we used to play  
I didn't think we'd  
Take it all the way  
It kills me just because  
It can't be erased,  
We're married

20281,Used,Hard To Say,"The singer finished singing and she's walking out  
The singer sheds a tear  
Fear of falling out  
  
And It's hard to say how I feel today  
For years gone by  
And I cried  
  
It's hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say that I miss you  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
  
My worries weigh the world  
How I used to be and everything  
(I'm so cold)  
Seems a plague in me  
  
And its hard to say how I feel today  
For years gone by  
And I cried  
  
It's hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say I miss you  
Since you've been gone its not the same  
Its hard to say I held my tongue  
It's hard to say if only  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
  
Worse than a lie you told a thousand times before  
Worse than a fear it's the knife  
And its hard to say how I feel today for years gone by and I cried  
Its hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say I miss you  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
It's hard to say I held my tongue  
It's hard to say if only  
Since you've been gone its not the same.

31448,Emmylou Harris,Boy From Tupelo,"You don't love me this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
I hung around a little too long  
I was good but now I'm gone  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
Any way the wind can blow  
That's where I'm gonna go  
I'll be gone like a five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
The shoulder I've been leanin' on  
Is the coldest place I've ever known  
There's nothin' left for me round here  
Looks like it's time to disappear  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
The old wall down in Jericho  
Maybelle on the radio  
I'll be gone like the five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
You don't love me, this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
It's a shame and it's a sin  
Everything I coulda been to you  
  
Your last chance Texaco  
Your sweetheart of the rodeo  
A Juliet to your romeo  
The border you cross into Mexico  
I'll never understand why or how  
Oh but baby its too late now  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know

8966,The Jam,Going Underground,"Some people might say my life is in a rut,  
But I'm quite happy with what I got  
People might say that I should strive for more,  
But I'm so happy I can't see the point.  
Somethings happening here today  
A show of strength with your boy's brigade and,  
I'm so happy and you're so kind  
You want more money - of course I don't mind  
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes  
And the public gets what the public wants  
But I want nothing this society's got.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going underground, (going underground)  
Well the brass bands play and feet start to pound  
Going underground, (going underground)  
Well let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow  
  
Some people might get some pleasure out of hate  
Me, I've enough already on my plate  
People might need some tension to relax  
[Me?] I'm too busy dodging between the flak  
What you see is what you get  
You've made your bed, you better lie in it  
You choose your leaders and place your trust  
As their lies wash you down and their promises rust  
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns  
And the public wants what the public gets  
But I don't get what this society wants  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We talk and talk until my head explodes  
I turn on the news and my body froze  
The braying sheep on my TV screen  
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!  
Going underground, I'm going underground!

12145,Louis Armstrong,I Got Rhythm,"I got rhythm....I got music....I got my gal  
Who can ask for anything more  
I got daisies....In green pastures....I got my gal  
Who could ask for anything more  
Old man trouble....I don't mind him.  
You won't find him.... 'round my door  
I got starlight...I got sweet dreams...I got my gal  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
I got rhythm....I got music....I got my gal  
Who can ask for anything more  
Who could ask for anything more

43211,Mary Black,Lay Down Your Burden,"It's a cold, old world that we're walking through  
They ought to tell you at the start  
But it's warm as toast walking two by two  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
I know you'll never miss it  
Just show me, angel, where it hurts  
And let your mammy kiss it  
  
It's a fine, fine line between love and hate  
It's hard to tell the two apart  
But what strength I have, I offer you  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
10756,Kirk Franklin,The Blood Song,"So many different religions  
And so many different churches  
And if God really loves me  
Then why does life keep hurting me?  
Have you ever asked any of these questions?  
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen  
  
You have the power  
To make the seasons change  
The river flows for you  
The wind whispers Your name  
For me you left Your throne  
And traded crown for thorns instead  
I'm safe within not by Your skin  
But because Your blood was red  
  
Some say You're black, you're white  
They question if you're real  
We treat you like we treat ourselves  
I wonder how you feel  
To see your children fight in spite  
of the tears for us you've shed  
Doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins  
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross  
It doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
We may be different but  
The God we serve's the same  
Yet every Sunday we separate  
And bring the Father pain  
Your name is higher than any other  
Yet You took my place instead  
And now my sins are washed away  
Because Your blood was red  
  
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins  
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross  
It doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
Oh precious is the flow  
That makes me white as snow  
No other fount I know  
Doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
Doesn't matter what color you are  
As you are as long as your blood was red  
Doesn't matter what color I am  
As long as my blood was red

41497,Leo Sayer,Paris Dies In The Morning,"I feel so lost and lonely  
Standing by the river Seine  
I don't know how I got here or why I came  
But everywhere I see her smiling face  
I remember  
We met somewhere in the back streets  
In this city of another age  
And talking broken English 'til the darkness came  
And in my room she called me by my name  
And she whispered  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
It disappears in the sunshine  
It's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
It's always gonna be that way  
When we made love in that hotel  
Like I never made before  
Thought I could die  
When she whispered slow  
Marai toujours  
She was wild and enchanting  
The night was like a dream  
We danced and sang the  
Sweetest harmony  
The words come back so clear  
I remember when we sang  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
[Solo]  
When I awoke in the morning  
She was nowhere to be found  
That's why I'm standing  
Waiting a t this river's edge  
I know we'll never meet again  
It was true when she said  
Paris dies in the morning  
(It ends this way)  
The moment when it steals your heart  
And then it loves you  
Paris dies I the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no no  
She disappeared in the morning light  
She said that it would end this way  
Did not believe her  
Paris dies in the morning light  
I know we'll never meet again  
[Solo]  
I know we'll never meet again  
She's gone  
Paris dies in the morning

"
31191,Elton John,I Can't Steer My Heart Clear Of You,"Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it  
After all these rough seas  
Left me reckless and abandoned  
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning  
Break down the cold front  
Give me peace and understanding  
  
And you wait, and you wonder  
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder  
Will she still be the star to see me through  
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
No I can't steer my heart clear of you  
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed  
Out of a storm and into view  
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue  
You control the weather  
And I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
Make me your penance, show me your innocence  
Everything is history  
From the aching to the pleasure  
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us  
Everything gets twisted  
Let me burn or bring me water

26128,Bon Jovi,Flesh And Bone,"They judge you by your money  
Or the color of your skin  
They read you by the cover  
Don't take time to read within  
  
They judge you without jury  
And you struggle to believe  
No one could hear your story  
Even justice had to leave  
All I know  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
They build the walls around you  
They tell you, you don't fit  
Still you think you know me  
You don't know the half of it  
  
I'm a beggar, you're a savior  
I'm your devil, you're a thief  
I'll be here until you realize  
I'm you and you are me  
  
All that I know  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone

All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
Do the cuts bleed any different  
On a pauper or a king?  
When it comes down to dyin'  
The crown don't mean a thing, no, no, no, no  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone

55898,Weird Al Yankovic,Generic Blues,"I woke up this morning  
Then I went back to bed  
Said I woke up this morning  
Then I went right back to bed  
Got a funny kind of feelin' like I got broken glass in my underwear  
And a herd of wild pigs is trying to chew off my head  
You know what I'm sayin'  
  
Well I ain't got not money  
I'm just walkin' down the road  
Said I ain't got no money, honey  
So I'm just walking down this lonely old road  
Well, I wish I could get me some money  
But I forgot my automated teller code  
  
I was born in a paper sack in the bottom of a sewer  
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast, my family was so poor  
My daddy was a waitress, my mama sold bathroom tiles  
My brothers and sisters all hated me 'cause I was an only child  
  
I got the blues so bad, woo  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead  
  
I'm just a no good, scum sucking, nose picking, boot licking,  
Sniveling, groveling, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Nothing but a low-down beer bellied, bone headed, pigeon toed,  
Turkey necked, weasel faced, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Guess I pretty low self image  
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something, I  
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time  
Make it talk  
Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk  
OK, now make it shut up  
  
Plagues and famine and pestilence always seem to get me down  
I always feel so miserable whenever I'm around  
I wish somebody would come along, stick a pitchfork through my brain  
I'd flush myself right down the toilet, but I'd just clog up the drain  
  
I got the blues so bad  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll go bowling  
Or I just might go bowling  
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling  
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid looking  
Shirt and go bowling instead  
Yeah

21516,Widespread Panic,Saint Ex,"Sometimes they see you just now they don't  
Maybe this is a lucky day or a penny on the way home  
Sit between the clouds for cover raindrops hide in the sea  
Olly olly oxen free  
  
The bliss of anonymity phonography of the heart  
A well executed smile the Wind, Sand and the Stars  
Words living in translation flowers under glass  
Oh the future slipping past  
  
Save me, slowly tame me  
Don't apologize with philosophy  
Come closer, tame me  
Don't you recognize we are not enemies  
  
Lamplighters and Counters kings and drunks and clowns  
Saddle up the planet ride to the heart of town  
Snakes do swallow elephants children all wear crowns  
If I knew I knew you I never would have shot you down  
  
Save me, slowly tame me  
Don't apologize with philosophy  
Come closer, tame me  
Don't you recognize we are not enemies  
  
Save me, slowly tame me  
Don't apologize with philosophy  
Come closer, tame me  
Don't you recognize we are not enemies

When you need someone to walk you home  
You know that I'll be there to understand  
When you call me on the phone  
I'll be there to watch you when you sleep  
When you close your eyes at night  
And I'll be there to keep your secrets kept

I ain't gonna love you  
'Cause I love you  
I'll be there to love the things you love  
I'll be the one who knows your middle name  
  
Be the only one that you can trust  
I'll give you the blood that's in my veins  
I swear these words are true  
There's only one thing I wouldn't do  
I ain't gonna love you

Nobody needs you like I need you  
You know I would beg and please, get down on my knees  
Do most anything for you  
But I ain't gonna love you  
I ain't gonna love  
'Cause I love you  
Because I love you

20016,Ultravox,Accent On Youth,"What is this phase that I am going through  
O these precious years  
Please take my hand and let me breathe again  
Young depressive tears  
We stumble blindly chasing something new and something sinful  
You take my time you live my life for me  
What have I done to rate this penalty  
You suck me dry  
My body cries  
We stumble blindly chasing instant thrills and lasting memories  
  
Accent on youth  
Attention  
Ascends on you  
  
I scream with frustration and lost control  
Open for the blows  
My hands fall limp and hang down by my side  
Take my soul and go  
We stumble blindly chasing dancing lights and others' wishes  
  
(Chorus)  
Just let me close my eyes and slip away  
Dream a dream alone  
You give me just enough rope for the task  
Let this man alone  
We stumble blindly chasing silhouettes and vacant faces  
So well rehearsed our moves once so graceful turn against us  
We stalk dark passages, we're looking for that sweet surrender

49634,Quietdrive,Arianne,"Passing on  
On my own it was  
Given to me  
By these  
Causes unknown I don't  
Know why  
We have to live  
In prisons like  
These words  
Hollow  
Though it's not too late  
To escape from it  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I don't live too long  
Before it  
Take a fall  
And just say  
It's alright  
Anywhere  
  
Take us to heaven

Because you know  
That I can't hear it  
Simple  
Just your living soul

I never  
So I thought that  
They were higher  
(I thought too)  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I know it  
Won't be long, will it?  
Take a fall  
And just say  
It's just wrong  
To come wanting  
(To come wanting)  
  
I don't even  
Know the answer  
But its not been (not been)  
Taken further (further)  
The very last one  
That you'll hear from  
  
Why'd you think I'd try to  
I don't even try to  
I don't even want to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even try to  
You don't even want to  
I don't even know that  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even want to  
You won't even know it  
I haven't even tried to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even like you  
I won't even  
Come near you  
But you'll try

The things that he has you'll never want to see  
What you're never gonna be now

You don't want to see him  
You only want to be him

Get back you're always gonna please him

I look like kiss but without the make up  
And that's a good line to take it to  
The bridge

And I'm trying to grow so before  
I'm old I'll confess  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
My bed's full of takeaways and fantasies  
Of easy lays  
The pause button's broke on my video  
And is this real 'cause I feel fake  
Oprah Winfrey Ricki Lake  
Teach me things I don't need to know  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And it's starting to show so before  
I'm old I'll confess  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
If I did it all again I'd be a nun  
The rain was never cold when I was young  
I'm still young we're still young  
Life's too short to be afraid  
Step inside the sun  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame
